* February 2025: Our production of [CABARET at Theatre
Rhinoceros](therhino.org), which got 
[great](https://theatrestorm.com/2024/11/26/review-cabaret-at-theatre-rhinoceros/)
[reviews](https://theatrius.com/2024/11/29/cabaret-roars-a-magnificent-prophetic-growl-at-rhino/),
was nominated for three Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle awards,
including overall production, principal actor, and music direction!

* October 2024: My Latino cabaret/cultural project, [Cantos de Mi
Tierra](cabaretlatinocantosdemitierra.com), will be performing at [UC
Berkeley on November
13](https://tickets4agoodcause.audience1st.com/store?show_id=76) and
at Martuni's in early 2025!

* September 2024: At the recent [Tapia Conference](tapiaconference.org),
Audrey Sillers and Elise Dorough (staff directors of 
student diversity at UC Berkeley EECS and U. Washington CS), Ed
Lazowska (faculty, U. Washington CS), and I presented our 
[advice](https://tapiaconference.cmd-it.org/attend/presentation/?id=psub153&sess=sess147)
on **Faculty-Staff Collaboration and Continuity for Equitable Recruiting
and Retention in CS graduate programs.**
Our
[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1St8trRG9a4n-BtMsmn_st8cDGvW1MvA_ycpW6QaUeIo/edit?usp=sharing)
are also being posted on the Tapia website.


* August 17, 2024: [Cantos de Mi Tierra](cantosdemitierra.com), the all-Spanish-language
cabaret featuring everything from traditional/folk to modern/pop music
of the Hispanic diaspora, had a great gig at Feinstein's At the Nikko!

* December 1, 2023: Great overview of Dan Garcia's and my efforts on
mastery learning in the [Berkeley Engineering
newsletter](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2023/12/making-the-grade/).
Also, this Inside Higher Ed [interview with VPUE Oliver
Oâ€™Reilly](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/blogs/learning-innovation/2023/11/13/three-questions-uc-berkeleys-oliver-oreilly)
discusses how computer-based testing and mastery learning can help
provide better accommodations for students with disabilities and
student athletes.

* November 29, 2023: Thanks to my colleagues [Arash
Pourhabibi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arashpourhabibizarandi/) and
[Saba Jamalian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabajamalian/), a new,
free translation into Persian of [Engineering Software as a Service
(ESaaS)](https://saasbook.info) is now available as a free PDF download!
 
* May 5, 2023: I was a [panelist]() on the topic of "networked learning" (basically,
[SPOCs](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/spocs-small-private-online-classes-may-be-better-than-moocs.html))
at the [Leveling the Learning Curve](https://leveling.college) event
at Columbia University.  Lots of great conversations with academic and
industry leaders about higher ed, and a chance to articulate ourindustry leaders about higher ed, and a chance to articulate our
vision of how digital learning technology can [foster mastery learning](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/cbt).

* May 1, 2023: The [final report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3Whcf5-JgF9wcmuj9jVWVLcZjR5zuOq/view?usp=sharing) from our pilot project on mastery
learning is available.  Our approach combines parameterized randomized
question generators (using UIUC's excellent
[PrairieLearn](prairielearn.org) authoring system) and a radical
approach to flexible deadlines (which we're developing further in our
[Flextensions](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/) project).  A key finding is that **while mastery
learning benefited all students in CS10, women and minoritized
students benefited relatively  more**, with the performance gap for
those students shrinking significantly since adopting our approach.

* April 1, 2023: Victor Huang and I presented a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569826) at SIGCSE
2023 on our changes to [CS 375](cs375.org), the CS pedagogy course required of all
first-time EECS GSIs.  From the abstract: "Our view is that there is no
meaningful separation between pedagogical and climate skills: rather
than `compartmentalizing' climate into specific workshops or modules
of a course, our semester-long required TA preparation course treats
classroom climate as a lens through which traditional pedagogical
skills are viewed, such as giving presentations that encourage
participation, creating equitable assessments, and creating successful
student groups by fostering belonging."

* January 23, 2023: It's great to be back at in-person 
events again, having great discussions about software engineering education at [FISEE
2023](https://www.laser-foundation.org/fisee/2023/), where I gave an
[invited keynote](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10clYQn9ka0Q2NZIWY0eqAXqpA7P1UAoe) bringing together many of our research efforts over
the past few years in
teaching both technical and team skills in upper-division
project-based software engineering.


* July 1, 2022: Great [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/30/how-berkeley-engineering-launched-three-black-aau-presidents) from Inside Higher Ed on how Berkeley Engineering launched three Black college presidents...but also a separate sobering article from Chronicle of Higher Ed profiling five professors of color who [left academia because of the poor climate at their institutions](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-they-left).

* May 24, 2022: The NSF-funded LEAP Alliance is
[recognized](https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/how-the-original-leap-alliance-advocates-increase-diversity-of-doctoral-programs-in-computing/)
for its efforts to improve diversity & equity in the computing
professoriate!  Audrey Sillers and I represent Berkeley in this
important effort.
