FC: *The Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America*, by Michael Reid

WMB: *White Man's Burden: Why Western Aid Doesn't Work* by Richard Easterly

Both address themes that come up over and over again in PJ O'Rourke's
libertarian-skewing *Eat the Rich* (ETR), still the most entertaining
and generally informative book I've read about the global role of
free-market economics.

I found FC whil looking for a concise treatment of LatAm history that
would answer the question: Why doesn't Latin America *work*
economically?  Europe has long had the EEC, then the EC, then the EU
and the Eurozone; Southeast Asia came from nowhere in the 1970s to a
combination of economic powerhouses (South Korea) and quite stable
countries you'd no longer call "developing" (Thailand); even eastern
Europe and some of the former Soviet states (the Baltics) have done
much better.  Yes, LatAm has had colonial exploitation and spells of
military authoritarianism, but so have those other regions, and LatAm
is largely unified by a common language and many aspects of a common
culture, which isn't the case in any of the other regions.

I found WMB serendipitously while browsing the bargain cart at [Bird &
Beckett](https://birdbeckett.com), my neighborhood independent
bookstore.  Over the last few years I've concluded that you can't
really understand domestic politics anywhere without understanding
economics, since the intersection of the two has to do with a
government's ability to provide basic services for its people and to
create an environment in which its people can prosper.  So it makes
sense to take the two together.

FC is written as a history, not as a treatise on the political
economics of LatAm, but I focus on the aspects of that
history that address my question, and their intersection with the
ideas in WMB and ETR.

## The state of LatAm in the 20th century

Many outsiders' view of LatAm is both anachronistic and somewhat
romanticized: poor/oppressed people trying to overcome decades of
colonialism who are easy prey for drug barons and military populists.
In fact, notwithstanding episodes of authoritarianism and command
economies, the evidence is that LatAms want what everyone
wants--basic freedoms, security, effective government that protects
their safety and property, and market conditions that create jobs,
opportunities, and social prosperity.  (That last sentence more or
less sums up ETR's main premise: free markets work really well, but
you need a minimal amount of effective government for them to
function.)  The typical 20th century LatAm citizen has better access
to both basic services and information about the
world than their parents and likely lives in a country where mostly-honest
elections are now the norm, and citizens can aspire to material
progress.  

Yet Western liberals are split between vicariously worshiping the Castros
and Chavezes as worthy solutions to LatAm's problems if only the
implementation were better, and failing to realize that weak states
foster both internal economic inequality and violent crime.


## Pre-20th century

The English who colonized the US came from an established
tradition of participatory, decentralized, parliamentary democracy.
The Spanish conquistadors brought Spain's militarized monarchical feudalism.
That model neither scales nor promotes economic growth: missives from the
king take months to get to the New World, and are ignored when they do
so because the state apparatus of force cannot effectively extend its
reach there, so local strongmen simply rule at their whim and arrogate
riches to themselves.
As well, life in many geographic areas of LatAm (eg the Andes) is
harsh, and the government's reach rarely extends there anyway, which
doesn't make them ripe for participatory government.

So when the colonies broke away, LatAm subjects didn't have a
democratic participatory model to follow; pre-conquistadors, they had
also been the subjects of empires, just smaller ones.
Once the conquistadors left, most of LatAm fell into a few decades of
rule by military strongmen.  The "modernists" or "reformers" bearing liberal European
ideas (the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, John Locke, Adam Smith)
were far from universally embraced by the people because they tended
to oppose things like communal land ownership, which had been part of
the fabric of pre-Columbian life.  In short, LatAm just wasn't ready
for those ideas, much as (IMO) Afghanistan wasn't ready to have a
Western-style democratic nation-state set up in 2002.

So that's LatAm history in a nutshell since the Spaniards left:
a push and pull between the rich and the poor,
between modernizers and conservatives, between democrats and authoritarians.

## Late 19th to early 20th century: a new liberalism

Liberalism in LatAm was somewhat resurgent in the late 19th c.,
spurred by the various [Revolutions of 1848 in
Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848), until
about the 1930s when it mutated into economic positivism, which holds
that the best government is one run scientifically by an intellectual
elite who know what is good for the people.  If that sounds like a
slippery slope from paternalism to corruption and authoritarianism, it
is.  It's not surprising that the pendulum would then swing towards
populist leaders, who were happy to advance the will of "the people",
just not through traditional democratic structures and only to the
extent it ultimately aligned with their own power-seeking.  **But the
more fundamental problem with populism is its
hostilility to property rights, which is incompatible
with a stable free market economy.**

## The Cold War

Before WW2, FDR's "good neighbor" policy limited US involvement in
LatAm, though sadly that meant the US also made no active effort to
promote democracy there.
After WW2 and the onset of the Cold War, LatAm was happy to line up
with the US against communism, but to the US it became more important for
governments to be overtly anti-communist than to be democratic, and
the US often failed to distinguish between socialist-leaning
nationalist reformers and actual communists, as when it crushed
democracy in Guatemala and effectively reinstated the corporatized
colonialism of United Fruit.  

Not surprisingly, this example simply
served to persuade left-wing elements that armed struggle was the only
way forward, and gave dictators such as Chile's Pinochet license to
say that extinguishing communism required suspending democracy since
it had clearly proved unworkable.
Just as the US overreached "fight communism" as "any
anti-communist government is preferable", revolutionaries such as
Castro focused not on establishing democracy but on extinguishing
imperialism.  (In fact Castro did not initially identify  as a
communist and concealed this intention until after the revolution.)
The combination of communism and authoritarianism turned Cuba into an
economic dependent of the Soviet Union; neoliberals worldwide thought
the fall of the Soviet Union would lead 
to reform in Cuba and elsewhere  (eg Fukuyama's *The End of History and the Last
Man*), but instead it became a dependent of China
and then of Chavez's Venezuela, with the result that today Cuba is
economically worse off than much of LatAm but less free.
Part of the repertoire of hypernationalism was to turn its back on the
global economy just when that was taking off; LatAm's global exports
as a fraction of GDP fell between 1965 and the 1970s.  Its new
industries were extractive, relying on imports of industrial machinery
and exports of non-price-dense goods and commodities (especially oil) with fluctuating
prices, a blueprint that is the opposite of what an economy needs to establish
itself through import substitution (as explained in [Jane Jacobs's *The
Economy of Cities*]({% post_url 2021-09-30-economy-cities %})).
Where Southeast Asian governments responded to the oil shocks of the
1970s by redoubling their attention on exports and globalization,
LatAm tried currency stabilization/devaluation and other macroeconomic
controls that work poorly in a globalized economy and ultimately.


Nonetheless, Castro's example inspired other LatAm revolutionaries,
including in Mexico; to which the US's default posture was "prevent
another Cuba".  (That stance led to the disaster in Nicaragua in
1979.) After the blood-soaked 1960s and 1970s, the left reevaluated
their love affair with this approach and came to value civil liberties
and a globalized free-market economy.  And it had become clear that
dictatorships, despite their ability to act by fiat, had been no more
successful in bringing economic stability than anyone else.  State
macroeconomic intervention and protectionism don't make for a stable
economy, no matter who is implementing them.  

Argentina was the
ultimate example of this.  In the late 1990s, an exodus from
developing economies began, starting with the devaluation of the Thai
baht in 1997.  To prevent currency value fluctuation, Argentina pegged their peso to the dollar,
which killed their exports, since their largest trading partner,
Brazil, couldn't afford them anymore; then they froze withdrawals,
essentially impoverishing people by suddenly making their saved money
effectively illiquid.  The only way out was forced deflation, to drive
nominal prices back down, but that is politically very difficult.
What was needed was to re-attract outside investment

## Economics

Resource curse: jobs don't pay much and don't result in transerable
skills; wealth gets concentrated; no national incentive to improve on
this equilibrium but the people don't get richer.  Also, resources are
commodities and these economies are highly subject to disruption from
global market forces; historically, governments respond poorly
(allowing unchecked inflation, or trying to peg the currency or
grossly devalue it).



# The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good

The title minces no words.  If
"successful" aid is that which grows an economy so that its
constituents no longer depend on aid, almost all
large aid programs "from the West to the Rest" have failed.  

The book combines the pro-free-market argument in ETR with the
argument for Agile vs. top-down software development:

* "Searchers" are do-gooders who are "on
the ground" in touch with local populations and can identify resources
necessary to solve a specific, limited problem.  Give them resources
and they can often make changes that are modest, but 
locally meaningful and directly and permanently boosting local quality
of life.  Because they operate with a business mindset, they also
don't repeat mistakes.

* "Planners" (aid agencies, western governments) create big plans from
afar without useful input from the folks who are supposed to receive
the help, without meaningful timely feedback mechanisms
to determine if the plan was effective, and without accountability
to the end users to either ensure effectiveness or place conditions on
continued aid.  ("The rich people who pay for the tickets aren't the
ones who see the movie"--p. 183.)  Because there's no feedback or
accountability, the same mistakes are made over and over.  The
Planners and their benefactors are rewarded for visible outcomes, but
since actual results aren't visible, the "outcomes" optimized for are
reports, summits, and shiny infrastructure that the recipient country
often can't maintain.

The 3 principles behind the argument are then:

1. Agencies work better with fewer/limited goals than
more/larger-scope goals;

2. Accountable agencies work better than unaccountable ones;

3. Agencies that can get rapid feedback from the beneficiaries work
better than those that can't.

So while "top-down" aid may plug a hole in the dike, as soon as the aid
runs out the recipients will be back where they started.  They may
even be worse off if (e.g.) the aid built infrastructure that cannot
then be maintained, such as roads, buildings, or US urban housing
projects like Cabrini Green.


The irony is that many of the same 
Planner politicians actually behave like Searchers
when it comes to getting things done in their home districts.
(In this regard, corporate/foundation aid does a bit better because
it's disbursed by entities with a business mindset--give the customer
what they want, and measure if they got it effectively.)

**The solution** is to empower Searchers directly, allowing them the
latitude to operate within the local environment they know well.


The book presents a fair amount of aid-program data to dispel various
aid myths, including:

* The Big Push: a country just needs a critical mass of aid to get
itself out of a hole; then its economy will take off.   (The inverse
hypothesis is the "poverty trap.")  But the data show that the average
poor country doesn't fit this pattern.  Rather, those countries
typically also make the list of worst-governed places.  As well, the
more aid was already in place, the less the effect of each dollar of
additional aid (as you'd expect in an entropic situation).

* Politics: aid linked to ideology is less effective than aid from a
nonpartisan agency or coalition.  In fact, studies found no difference
between the effects of "politicized" vs. non-politicized aid.  (Though
aid linked to purchases from the donor country, like much US aid, is
even worse, since a good part of the aid then just flows back to the
rich country.)

One fallacy is to assume that because someone has studied and worked
in a prosperous and peaceful society, they know enough to plan how to
achieve that in other societies.

### Even a modest profit motive can be effective in the service of aid.

A program in Malawi by Population Services International (a
"searcher" type agency) sells bed nets for 50 cents to prenatal
clinics; the nurses who distribute them keep 9 cents per net,
providing an incentive to always have them in stock.  PSI
also sells nets to richer Malawians at a markup to subsidize the
program, which pays for itself.  Net usage is much higher than in
Zambia, where free nets were distributed to people whether they wanted
them or not.  Similarly (p. 208) Hindustan Lever Limited started
educational campaigns and programs to inform less-educated/poor people
about the health value of washing their hands, which allowed it to
sell more soap while reducing diarrheal diseases resulting from poor
hygiene.  These are examples of how even modest free-market incentives
can be made to work in favor of aid goals.
(Indeed, since the 1970s, Southeast Asia has more or less permanently
lifted itself out of poverty by developing free markets, while Latin
America and Africa remain much more aid-dependent.)


### But free markets need the right conditions in which to function...

For example, when the Soviet Union fell, the  network
of "pushers" or Tolkachi (O'Rourke talks about them in ETR) that had
learned to "cheat" and build fiefdoms within the ineffective command
economy had a built-in advantage.  A "free market" was created but without the accompanying
rules that make profit-seeking behavior beneficial to society.  Put
another way, your
right to your property is only as strong as those around you are
willing to acknowledge, whether they acknowledge that right out of
trust in societal institutions/norms (including government) or out of
fear of having both kneecaps broken.  (This nuance is part of the
wrinkle in Hernando De Soto's book *The Mystery of Capital* a few
years back, arguing that what LatAms need is title to their land/homes so
they can collateralize it. In fact, they also need to be within a
system in which they can be confident in the outcome of such behavior.)

Such failures can happen at the state level as well without good
protections for creditors.  In the early 90s, Mexico allowed buyers of
banks to finance the purchase with loans from the bank being bought.
Yet individuals continued to trust those banks because the Mexican
government insured their savings (like the FDIC).  The avalanche of
bad credit ultimately led to the collapse of the peso in 1994, but the
bank's owners then made large loans to themselves (effectively looting
the banks) since they knew the government's policy guaranteed a bailout.

### ...and "reforms" aimed at creating those conditions usually fail.

Partial reforms to create good protections often fail, because their effects get
swamped by the rest of an incompatible system; yet total reforms are
basically impossible.  If you try to run two systems side-by-side
within a society, there's a huge opportunity for bad actors to
asymetrically exploit one against the other, or exit one system on bad
terms only to enter the other system "clean".  
A solution is to gradually introduce formal rules that reinforce, rather than
trying to replace, how existing networks have evolved.

### But aid agencies keep giving, because even though the game is rigged, it's the only game in town.

Aid agencies are rewarded
for observable outputs, such as lots of reports and meetings, and for setting
goals, which are observable where results are not (so not only are
they ineffective but they duplicate effort).  Shiny new buildings are
much more observable by donors than, say, textbooks or mosquito
nets.  And, tragically, money spent on treatment for AIDS patients
(which in the 1990s was extremely expensive and would prolong each
life by a few months or years) is more observable than money spent on
prevention and education programs, which could save many more lives
for much less money but are often ideologically hamstrung, such as
forbidding the use of birth control or the recommendation to use
condoms (p. 244, 251-252, 254-255).
(Bill Gates is a notable exception in his foundation's rational
approach to philanthropy.)  

Hence, even in countries that aren't so bad, a distortedly large sector of
the economy consists of bureaucrats tied up in the aid
industry who present the contact surface needed to court rich
benefactors with delusions of grandeur. In contrast, the
actual poor people with specific needs have no such channel or
political voice.  The bureaucracy required to translate national aid
dollars to a specific project on the ground, the amount of leakage
therein, and the relative lack of a voice from the beneficiaries of
those projects, are a recipe for repeated failure and disillusionment.
In contrast, if the Planners would just pass the money on to the
Searchers, the Searchers would likely be able to produce piecemeal but
visible results that make the bureaucracy look good while actually
doing some good.  For example, they could chip away at
business-hostile practices that make it more difficult or expensive to
start a business, enforce a financial contract, or collect a bad debt
(p. 111).

### Bad government <=> bad aid, especially in "resource curse" countries, but good government is hard to come by.

Countries with bad/unaccountable governments are most likely to have
fiscal, distribution, etc. infrastructures that are corrupt or
dysfunctional or both, so their people are poor and those countries
get the most aid, but the aid doesn't reach the right people; yet
getting good government in place is really hard. The top 15
recipients of aid in 2002 ($1B+ each) had  median ranking in the
most corrupt quartile of all world governments.  In
natural-resource-rich countries, there is a government-level
disincentive to develop new sources of income rather than exploiting
the resource, which is both volatile (commodity prices are fickle) and
bad for the actual workers.  As an example (p.122), Caribbean sugar
plantations were much wealthier than the American colonies prior to
the Industrial Revolution, since they relied on slave labor to produce
one product at large scale, but it concentrated the wealth in an
oligarchy.  New Englanders had small family farms, but democratic
government with equal rights and protection for most citizens, so when
the IR did happen, they were poised to take advantage of it to grow
both their regional economies and individuals' prosperity.  Worse, in
an self-reinforcing oligarchical society, the rich want just enough
democracy to protect their standing but not so much that a
democratic-but-poor majority might choose to redistribute wealth.
Hence resource-rich countries whose economies concentrate wealth swing
between populism (atempting redistribution) and autocracy (the rich
striking back by buying the military) (p.123).  (As Daniel Patrick
Moynihan has said [p. 144], "The socially concerned
intellectuals...seemed repeatedly to assume that those who had power
would let it be taken away..."

The roots of this problem can be as deep as
whether the countries have experienced a British-like common-law
tradition, in which legal principles follow case rulings and therefore
the law can adapt to reality on the ground, or a French/Spanish
top-down civil-law tradition, in which judges are glorified clerks
applying a rigig written law.  (FC makes this observation about LatAm
vs. the American colonies.)  Indeed, countries with British legal
origins do have better personal-property protections in practice than
those with French or Spanish legal origins.

All of the above notwithstanding, IMF and World Bank aid often comes
with strings attached, or in the form of deals made with governments
basically run by gangsters, leaving the population of the country as a
whole liable for IMF loans that will never reach them and which they
can never repay.  And the question is not whether a government is good
or bad relative to a country's level of income, but whether it is good
enough to sustain a free market, period.
Countries go to the IMF
precisely when they are desperate, making it unlikely that they are
stable.  (Historically there is no country so fucked up or
uncreditworthy that the IMF
will refuse it a loan.)
Yet in structuring its loans the IMF more or less assumes the
stability it's trying to create.
In trying to create that stability, the IMF attaches conditions to its
loans that amount to telling the government how to spend the money,
including taking fiscal-policy actions that  may be unpopular, for
which the government then gets blamed or overthrown.  Indeed, overall
there is a correlation between spending a lot of time in IMF programs
and the risk of suffering state collapse.
Many IMF loans don't get paid back and
are forgiven, which further reduces the incentive for borrower
countries to be disciplined.

Case in point: in 1999, Argentine president Carlos Menem went on a
social-program spending spree to boost his reelection chances.  This
failed and put the country in such deep debt that it said it would not
honor debts to foreign creditors.  The IMF put together a bailout that
simply postponed the collapse by a few months at a cost of $80
billion.  And the IMF isn't even an aid agency.

One driver of economic growth is a certain degree of trust in
strangers (p. 79)--if I extend you credit, can I be assured of being paid?
Yet low-income societies have lower trust than rich ones--both of
their governments and of each other--an obstacle to growth.
In a transaction in which neither side trusts the other, a long term
business relationship isn't possible, or incentivized.  The general
result is "cash transactions for low-quality goods and services."  Not
a great blueprint for growth.
Ethnic/expat networks can help create informal "guilds" within which
reputations must be maintained (Hasidic Jews in NYC's diamond
district, Luo fishermen in Kenya, Chinese nationals almost everywhere
in their diaspora) but also run the risk of creating exclusion and
inviting ethnic hostility when times get hard.
