title: "Two books on developing regions: The Forgotten Continent, White Man's Burden"
categories: ["Book summary" ]
---

This is a combined summary of two books that overlap a third:

* FC: *The Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America*, by Michael Reid

* WMB: *The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have
Done So Much Ill and So Little Good* by Richard Easterly

* ETR: PJ O'Rourke's
free-market-libertarian *Eat the Rich* (ETR), still the most entertaining
and generally informative book I've read about the global role of
free-market economics.

I was originally seeking a concise treatment of LatAm history that
would answer the question: Why doesn't Latin America *work*
economically?  Europe has had the EEC, then the EC, then the EU
and the Eurozone; Southeast Asia came from nowhere in the 1970s to a
combination of economic powerhouses (South Korea) and quite stable
countries you'd no longer call "developing" (Thailand); even eastern
Europe and some of the former Soviet states (the Baltics) have done
much better.  Yes, LatAm has had colonial exploitation and spells of
military authoritarianism, but so have those other regions, and LatAm
is largely unified by a common language and many aspects of a common
culture, which isn't the case in any of the other regions.

I found WMB serendipitously while browsing the bargain cart at [Bird &
Beckett](https://birdbeckett.com), my neighborhood independent
bookstore.  

I already believed, from ETR, that government's ability to provide
basic services for its people and to create an environment in which
its people can prosper are fundamental to economic growth.  So it
makes sense to take the two books together.

FC is written as a history, not as a treatise on the political
economics of LatAm, but I focus on the aspects of that
history that address my question, and their intersection with the
ideas in WMB and ETR.

# TL;DR

Free markets work really well at raising overall prosperity--indeed,
nothing else has been shown to work nearly as well.  But free markets
need societal and governmental conditions in which to flourish---weak states
foster both internal economic inequality and violent crime---and
where those conditions are absent, they cannot be imposed top-down or
wholesale, but must be created incrementally from within.  

Therefore,
if you want to help, help the people on the ground who are doing
incremental but concrete things from within, not the "top down
planners" who aren't accountable to the people they're trying to help.

## LatAm in the 20th century and previously

Many outsiders' view of LatAm is both anachronistic and somewhat
romanticized: poor/oppressed people trying to overcome decades of
colonialism who are easy prey for drug barons and military populists.
In fact, notwithstanding episodes of authoritarianism and command
economies, the evidence is that LatAms want what everyone
wants--basic freedoms, security, effective government that protects
their safety and property, and market conditions that create jobs,
opportunities, and social prosperity.  (That last sentence more or
less sums up ETR's main premise: free markets work really well, but
you need a minimal amount of effective government for them to
function.)  The typical 20th century LatAm citizen has better access
to both basic services and information about the
world than their parents and likely lives in a country where mostly-honest
elections are now the norm, and citizens can aspire to material
progress.  

Yet Western liberals are split between vicariously worshiping the Castros
and Chavezes as worthy solutions to LatAm's problems if only the
implementation were better, and failing to realize that weak states
foster both internal economic inequality and violent crime.

The US colonists came from a British tradition of
common law (legal principles generalize from case rulings and therefore
the law can adapt to reality on the ground),
participatory, decentralized, and parliamentary democracy.
The French/Spanish colonizers
brought militarized monarchical feudalism and top-down civil-law
tradition, in which judges are glorified clerks 
applying a rigid prescriptive written law.
That model neither scales nor promotes economic growth: missives from the
king take months to get to the New World, and are ignored when they do
get there because the state apparatus of force cannot effectively extend its
reach, so local strongmen simply rule at their whim and arrogate
riches to themselves.
Even today, postcolonial countries with British legal
origins have better personal-property protections in practice than
those with French or Spanish legal origins.

So when the LatAm colonies broke away, LatAm subjects didn't have a
democratic participatory model to follow; they had
essentially only been the subjects of empires.
Two kinds of governments/leaders emerged:

* "Modernists" or "reformers" bearing liberal European
ideas (the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, John Locke, Adam Smith),
spurred by the various [Revolutions of 1848 in
Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848). These were
often opposed by the people because they tended 
to oppose things like communal land ownership, which had been part of
the fabric of pre-Columbian life.  The economic positivists, who believed
that the best government is one run scientifically by an intellectual
elite who know what is good for the people, formed a 
slippery slope from paternalism to corruption and authoritarianism and
often laid the groundwork for populist revolts.

* Populist strongmen promising to
advance the will of "the people",
just not through traditional democratic structures and only inasfar as
they can stay in power. 

LatAm history since the Spaniards left has been a push and pull
between these poles.  **But for the purposes of our argument, the
fundamental problem with populism is its hostilility to property
rights, which is incompatible with sustaining a free market.**

The common ingredient is not whether a country or colony has been
primarily "imperialist/colonial" or primarily "populist/socialist",
but whether it has created conditions that can sustain a free market.
For example,  after WW2 and the onset of the Cold War, US policy was that  it was more important for
governments to be anti-communist than to be democratic, and
the US often failed to distinguish between socialist-leaning
nationalist reformers and actual communists, as when it crushed
democracy in Guatemala and effectively reinstated the corporatized
colonialism of United Fruit.  
Not surprisingly, this example simply
served to persuade left-wing elements that armed struggle was the only
way forward, and gave dictators such as Chile's Pinochet license to
say that extinguishing communism required suspending democracy since
it had clearly proved unworkable.  An oligarchy was the predictable result.
In contrast, 
the combination of *communism* and authoritarianism turned Cuba into an
economic dependent of the Soviet Union, and later China and Venezuela
after the Societ collapse;  today Cuba is
economically worse off than much of LatAm but still less free.

## Turning their backs on globalization

Countries whose economies focus on extractive natural resources (oil,
diamonds, minerals) suffer from the *resource curse:* the jobs pay
little and don't result in transerable skills, the society increases
its reliance on imported industrial machinery and expertise to improve
margins,  
and since wealth gets concentrated, those in control have no incentive
to develop new sources of income, even though the rest of the populace
stays poor.  Indeed (WMB p.122), Caribbean sugar plantations were
wealthier than the small-family-farm American colonies prior to the
Industrial Revolution, but New England's democratic government with
equal rights and protection for most citizens created conditions for
them to take advantage of the IR when it did happen.

In a self-reinforcing oligarchy, the rich want just enough
democracy to protect their own standing but not so much that a
democratic-but-poor majority might choose to redistribute wealth.
Hence, "resource-curse" countries swing between oligarchy and populism.
(As Daniel Patrick
Moynihan has said [p. 144], "The socially concerned
intellectuals...seemed repeatedly to assume that those who had power
would let it be taken away.")

Also, resources are non-price-dense commodities highly subject to
price fluctuation due to global market forces.
This blueprint  is the exact *opposite* of what an economy needs to establish
itself through import substitution (as explained in [Jane Jacobs's *The
Economy of Cities*]({% post_url 2021-09-30-economy-cities %})).

When Southeast Asian governments responded to the oil shocks of the
1970s by redoubling their attention on exports and globalization, with
South Korea (for example) developing entire new
industries,
hypernationalist LatAm governments instead turned towards resource economies.
When these plans stumbled, governments tried currency
stabilization/devaluation and other macroeconomic 
controls that work particularly  poorly in the newly-globalized economy.
For example, in 1997 global currency markets plunged as the result of
an exodus from the overleveraged Thai baht; in response, Argentina pegged their peso to the
dollar to keep its value high.  This killed their exports, since their largest trading partner,
Brazil, couldn't afford them anymore; then Argentina froze withdrawals,
impoverishing people by making their saved money
illiquid.  The only way out was forced deflation, to drive
nominal prices back down, but that is politically very difficult.

State
macroeconomic intervention and protectionism don't make for a stable
economy, whether implemented by progressives or despots, and a
globalized economy makes many traditional such interventions
ineffective anyway.

# Good aid

If "successful" aid is that which grows an economy so that its
constituents reduce their dependence on that very aid, almost all
large aid programs "from the West to the Rest" have failed.

The book combines the pro-free-market argument in ETR with the
argument for Agile vs. top-down software development:

* "Searchers" are do-gooders who are "on
the ground" in touch with local populations and can identify resources
necessary to solve a specific, limited problem.  Because they operate
with a business mindset--"do more with less"--they also 
don't repeat mistakes.

* "Planners" (aid agencies, western governments) create big plans from
afar without useful input from the folks who are supposed to receive
the help, without meaningful timely feedback mechanisms
to determine if the plan was effective, without accountability
to the end users to either ensure effectiveness or place conditions on
continued aid, and most importantly, often ignorant of the fact that
the target country lacks the societal/governmental conditions required
for the "programs" to succeed.  ("The rich people who pay for the tickets aren't the
ones who see the movie"--p. 183.)  Because there's no feedback or
accountability, the same mistakes are made over and over.  The
Planners and their benefactors are rewarded for visible outcomes, but
since actual results aren't visible, the "outcomes" optimized for are
reports, summits, and shiny infrastructure that the recipient country
often can't maintain.

The 3 principles behind the argument are then:

1. Agencies work better with fewer/limited goals than
more/larger-scope goals;

2. Accountable agencies work better than unaccountable ones;

3. Agencies that can get rapid feedback from the beneficiaries work
better than those that can't.

So while "top-down" aid may plug a hole in the dike, as soon as the aid
runs out the recipients will be back where they started, with (eg)
infrastructure that cannot
then be maintained, such as roads, buildings, or US urban housing
projects like Cabrini Green.
(Corporate/foundation aid does a bit better because
it's disbursed by entities with a business mindset--give the customer
what they want, and measure if they got it effectively.)

**The solution** is to work to make individuals better off, rather than trying
to "fix" governments or societies; better-off individuals have a
better shot of doing that from within than you do from without.  (p. 368)
To that end, you should empower Searchers directly, allowing them the
latitude to operate within the local environment they know well. 

The book presents a fair amount of aid-program data to dispel various
aid myths, including:

* Myth: The Big Push -- a country just needs a critical mass of aid to get
itself out of a hole; then its economy will take off.   (The inverse
hypothesis is the "poverty trap.")  Fact: the data show that the average
poor country doesn't fit this pattern.  Rather, those countries
typically also make the list of worst-governed places.  As well, the
more aid was already in place, the less the effect of each dollar of
additional aid (as you'd expect in an entropic situation).

* Myth: aid linked to political ideology is less effective than aid from a
nonpartisan agency or coalition.  Fact: studies found no difference, though
aid linked to purchases from the donor country, like much US aid, is
even worse, since a good part of the aid then just flows back to the
rich country.

* Myth: someone who has studied and worked
in a prosperous and peaceful society knows enough to plan how to
achieve that in other societies.  Fact: they don't.

### Even a modest profit motive can be effective in the service of aid.

A program in Malawi by Population Services International (a
"searcher" type agency) sells bed nets for 50 cents to prenatal
clinics; the nurses who distribute them keep 9 cents per net,
providing an incentive to always have them in stock.  PSI
also sells nets to richer Malawians at a markup to subsidize the
program, which pays for itself.  Net usage is much higher than in
Zambia, where free nets were distributed to people whether they wanted
them or not.  Similarly (p. 208) Hindustan Lever Limited started
educational campaigns and programs to inform less-educated/poor people
about the health value of washing their hands, which allowed it to
sell more soap while reducing diarrheal diseases resulting from poor
hygiene.  

### But free markets need the right conditions in which to function...

**Your
right to your property is only as strong as those around you are
willing to acknowledge, whether out of
trust in societal institutions/norms (including government) or out of
fear of having both kneecaps broken.**  
(Hernando De Soto's *The Mystery of Capital* a few 
years back argued that  LatAms need legal title to their land/homes so
they can collateralize it, but that presupposes a
system they can trust to enforce that ownership.  Interestingly, 
in [Radical Cities]({% post_url 2018-12-13-radical-cities  %}#anti-desoto),
Greenfield quotes Brazilian academic Jailson de Souza saying that
a co-op/rent-control model would be better, since if you
gave them title to their land, they'd sell it for a quick buck and end
up back where they started. This is in a sense what the Swiss
government does with property now, giving interest-only long-term mortgages.)

Such failures can happen at the state level as well without good
protections for creditors.  In the early 90s, Mexico allowed buyers of
banks to finance the purchase with loans from the bank being bought.
Yet individuals continued to trust those banks because the Mexican
government insured their savings (like the FDIC).  The avalanche of
bad credit ultimately led to the collapse of the peso in 1994, but the
bank's owners then made large loans to themselves (effectively looting
the banks) since they knew the government's policy guaranteed a bailout.

### ...and "reforms" aimed at creating those conditions usually fail.

Partial reforms to create good protections often fail, because their effects get
swamped by the rest of an incompatible system; yet total reforms are
basically impossible.  For example, one driver of economic growth is a
certain degree of trust in 
strangers (p. 79)--if I extend you credit, can I be assured of being paid?
(If not, you get a society based on "cash transactions for low-quality goods and services,"  not
a great blueprint for growth.)
Low-income societies (which tend to be badly governed) don't trust
their government to create these conditions; guilds and ethnic/expat
networks help somewhat, though at the risk of ethnic hostility.

Yet if you try to "reform" by running <a name="twosystems">two systems</a> side-by-side
within a society,  bad actors can
asymetrically exploit one against the other, or exit one system on bad
terms only to enter the other system "clean".  
When the Soviet Union fell, the network
of "pushers" or Tolkachi (O'Rourke talks about them in ETR) that had
learned to "cheat" and build fiefdoms within the ineffective command
economy had a built-in advantage.  A "free market" was created, but without the accompanying
rules that make profit-seeking behavior beneficial to society.

A solution is to gradually introduce formal rules that reinforce, rather than
trying to replace, how existing networks have evolved.

### But aid agencies keep giving, because even though the game is rigged, it's the only game in town.

Aid agencies are rewarded (by new infusions of donor cash)
for observable outputs, such reports, meetings, and shiny buildings, and for setting
*goals*, which are observable where results are not.
Buildings are more observable by donors than, say, textbooks or mosquito
nets.  Money spent on treatment for AIDS patients
(which in the 1990s was extremely expensive and would prolong each
life by a few months or years) is more observable than money spent on
prevention and education programs, which could save many more lives
for much less money.  And even without that obstacle, some such
programs are ideologically hamstrung, such as  
forbidding the use of birth control or
condoms (p. 244, 251-252, 254-255).
(Bill Gates is a notable exception in his foundation's rational
approach to philanthropy.)  

Hence, even in countries that aren't so bad, a distortedly large sector of
the economy consists of bureaucrats tied up in the aid
industry who present the contact surface needed to court rich
benefactors with delusions of grandeur.  The
actual poor people with specific needs have no
voice in this process.  The bureaucracy, leakage, and lack of voice or
feedback from the afflicated, lead to repeated failure and disillusionment.
In contrast,  Searchers could produce piecemeal but
visible results that make the bureaucracy look good while actually
doing some good, such as chipping away at
business-hostile practices that make it more difficult or expensive to
start a business, enforce a financial contract, or collect a bad debt
(p. 111).

### Bad government <=> ineffective aid, especially in "resource cursed" countries

Countries with bad/unaccountable governments are most likely to have
fiscal, distribution, etc. infrastructures that are corrupt or
dysfunctional or both, so their people are poor and those countries
get the most aid, but the aid doesn't reach the right people; yet
getting good government in place is really hard. The top 15
recipients of aid in 2002 ($1B+ each) had  median ranking in the
most corrupt quartile of all world governments, and these were often
"resource cursed" countries.

Yet in structuring its loans the IMF assumes the
stability it's trying to create.
In trying to create that stability, the IMF may basically
try to tell the government how to spend the money,
including taking fiscal-policy actions that  may be unpopular, for
which the government then gets blamed or overthrown.  
Or it may make deals with governments run by gangsters, which will
never be honored and will leave the population of the country as a
whole liable for loans that will never reach them and which they can
never repay.  (The IMF/WB considers whether a government is good or
bad *relative* to a country's level of income, but the key factor is
whether it is good enough to sustain a free market, *period*.)
Indeed, countries go to the IMF precisely when they are desperate,
making it unlikely that they are stable.  (Historically there is no
country so screwed up or uncreditworthy that the IMF will refuse it a
loan.)  Indeed, overall there is a correlation between spending a lot
of time in IMF programs and the risk of suffering state collapse.
Many IMF loans don't get paid back and are forgiven, which further
reduces the incentive for borrower countries to be disciplined.

Case in point: in 1999, Argentine president Carlos Menem went on a
social-program spending spree to boost his reelection chances.  This
failed and put the country in such deep debt that it said it would not
honor debts to foreign creditors.  The IMF put together a bailout that
simply postponed the collapse by a few months at a cost of $80
billion.

A similar argument applies to colonial and postcolonial countries.
Colonialism introduced all sorts of problems of course, but when
Western powers drew new national postcolonial boundaries (as most
egregiously in Africa) that put together hostile ethnic groups and
divide solid ones, they just sow the seeds of ineffective government.
Following up with utopian-level aid gives a predictable result.
"Interventionism [whether colonial or post-colonial] suffers from the
patronizing assumption that only the West can keep the locals from
killing each other. Stanford political scientist Jeremy Weinstein
notes that peace usually succeeds war because of a decisive victory by
one side, not because of negotiated settlements by outsiders."
(p. 334)  The author points out the "strange confluence" of
neoconservatives hawks supporting "regime change" and leftist
humanitarians calling for military intervention to stop human rights
abuses, a cycle leading to "endless wars of altruism."

As Paul Theroux notes in *Dark Star Safari*, "only Africans can fix
Africa," and this book generalizes the argument as to why: there is no simple solution to
getting decent government, creating the conditions in which a free
market can raise prosperity, and incrementally finding ways in the
meantime to make specific modest improvements, possibly in furtherance
of those goals, but it has to come from the inside.
"...gross violations of free markets and brutal self-aggrandizing
autocrats usually preclude success.  Beyond that breathtakingly
obvious point, there is no automatic formula for success, only many
political and economic Searchers looking for piecemeal improvements
that overcome the many obstacles..." (p. 363).
