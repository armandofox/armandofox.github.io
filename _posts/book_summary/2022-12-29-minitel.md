## Minitel: Welcome To the Internet

In the 1980s, when a "consumer-facing Internet" was still
over a decade away, France's Minitel system introduced French
citizens to much of what they'd be doing on the Internet years later.
Despite being centrally planned, its architectural combination of central control
and some distributed/market-incentive features resulted in a lot of
innovation and serve to test the hypothesis that only a
fully-decentralized free-market Internet could have succeeded.

France Telecom distributed free Minitel terminals to anyone who wanted
them; they were essentially smart terminals with 80x24 grayscale
monitors that could also display over 300 Latin-1 glyphs as well as
low-res graphics by using "semi-graphic" character glyphs (in
practice, these were realized on a 2-column by 3-row grid per glyph),
PSTN direct-connect modems (by default, 1200 baud down and 75 baud up,
but this could be changes in software), and a chiclet keyboard.

An optional smartcard reader could let the terminal function as a POS
system (in an area where US retailers still used paper credit-card
imprint slips) or run software from a smartcard.
