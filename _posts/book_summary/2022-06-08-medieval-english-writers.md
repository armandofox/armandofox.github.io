**Medieval Writers and Their Work: Middle English Literature and its
Background, 1100-1500**

by J.A. Burrow

I've always had some interest in Middle English literature, and in
general intellectual and artistic development during the Middle Ages.
This book was on the "free stuff" cart at a local bookstore so I
grabbed it.  It's a very readable exposition on how to approach
reading medieval (and particularly Middle English) literature.

## Authors and Audiences: There were no "writers"


The notion of "author" as we think of it today had not
yet developed.  There were poets, goliards, compilers, narrators,
adaptors; but it would take time to crystallize the idea of
"attribution as a novel
primary creator of a work of fiction or nonfiction."
Indeed, prose fiction, including the Italian _novella_ (e.g. the
Decameron of Bocaccio) and French _nouvelle_, hardly influenced Middle
English literature.

Early Anglo-Saxon sagas were preserved in runes and later by scribes
using the Roman alphabet (the four great surviving codices of
Anglo-Saxon poetry were probably produced in scriptoria); indeed n
preservation and dissemination of these works and of great authors of
the past would be considered a worthy pursuit of a "writer" of the
time.  Indeed, when writers as actually identify themselves (most
don't; for example, we don't know who authored _Sir Gawain_), it is
"with the humility of the petitioner rather than the pride of the
poet" (p. 38):
the _explicit_ at the end of Caxton's printing of Sir
Thomas Malory's _La Morte d'Arthur_ beseeches his audience to pray for
him (Caxton) in his role as a servant of God.
Not until the arrival of mass technology for printing 
and the [arrival of the

did the
demand for written material increase to the point where it created a
market for authors as we now know them.

As well, people treated books much as musical scores are treated
today--as the blueprint for a performance. Medieval texts were
generally intended to be performed and heard, not read (as 
illiteracy was high anyway).  For this reason, there are medieval
genres with no correspondent today, such as "everyday poetry" for
entertainment (think the Goliards).

## Genres: Comedy or Tragedy?

Despite being designed to be read or spoken, medieval works such as
the morality plays (eg _Everyman_) don't cleave neatly into tragedy or
comedy.  Instead, we might distinguish three categories:

* Histories, which deal with long timescales (historical/allegorical
time, e.g. from the rise and fall of Man until today)

* Lives (of famous knights, saints, etc.), which can comprise both
historical time and lifetimes of individuals; 
_The Tale of Robin Hood_ is somewhere between these two categories

* Tales, fictional and allegorical, with characters more likely to represent
archetypes than notional individuals, or else representing a "generic _I_" (as in a courtly love
complaint).   _The Canterbury Tales_ is among the best known examples
of that category (as the _Decameron_ is outside of England).
Even the prologue to Chaucer's _Troilus_ makes
clear that this is a _tale_ about Troilus's tragic love, not a
_history_ of the siege of Troy.

French romantic poetry influenced not only Middle English (via the Norman
conquest) but really all of medieval western Europe because of France's importance. 
One of its  dominant early forms was romance (in prose or verse),
to the extent that some characterize the era as "The Age of Romance"
(as against an earlier "Age of Epic").  
Guillaume de Lorris's _Roman
de la Rose_ took the important step of establishing a new type of
vernacular narrative poem an allegorical or symbolical world, often in
the form of a dream or vision, in which persons and events shadow the
experiences of love in the real world.  But other, lighter forms of
allegory, such as the _fabliaux_, also provided the basis for (e.g.)
some of the Canterbury Tales, including the Miller's Tale and the
Reeve's Tale.  

## Modes of Meaning: Allegory and Exemplification

**Allegory**: the reader must translate between two paradigms.
E.g. in Langland's _Piers Plowman_, a long allegory asks what value
learning and intelligence contribute to a "good Christian life",
through encounters between the dreamer Will and various
personifications representing learning and intelligence.
These personifications not only "stand for" Conscience, Learning,
etc. but actually have those names in the work.
However, this personification can be problematic for translators and
transcribers, as Middle English scribes typically didn't use capital
letters, so it is hard to tell whether the intended meaning is
"...because fear
held him back" vs. "...because Fear held him back".
In some cases, allegory came from treating an earlier historical event 


**Exemplification** generalizes a lesson from an example, like a fable
or parable. Dante's Inferno is full of them, with personifications of
the seven deadly sins.  Chaucer's _Pardoners Tale_ is an _exemplum_ of
avarice. 

## The Survival of Middle English Literature

With the dawning of the Age of Reason, interest in medieval literature
began to decline, as interest in rediscovering the classics rose.  

Modern English literature is basically a creation of the Tudor age,
and some elements of Middle English writers and writing were
incorporated into its canon posthumously.  Besides the political unity
of the Tudor dynasty, two other factors influenced the creation of
literature.

First was the arrival of the printing press; the first book
printed in England was Caxton's _History of Troy_, around 1473.  For
works that got published, uniform and consistent reproduction
increased the chances they would be read and understood widely.  (_Sir
Gawain_ didn't appear in print until 1824.)

Second was the "Chancery standard" of orthography developed by
15th-century scribes and clerks.  While the language has changed since
then, its history has been continuous.

Still, in the 1600s, some wealthy individuals commissioned
transcriptions of their own written copies of medieval works they
could not otherwise own in print.
In other cases, such as the Chester
mystery plays, the works survived in print because they were treated
as scripts for performing the plays, and the people of Chester
maintained a strong interest in that tradition into the 17th century.
Wealthy scholars critiqued and discussed certain works and not others,
so the extent to which we can contextualize those works (see them
through the eyes of closer contemporaries) varies correspondingly.
There was much discussion and critique of _Canterbury_, but much less
about (e.g.) _Sir Gawain_.  We are beholden to the interests of the
educated and wealthy for what has been most strongly passed down.
