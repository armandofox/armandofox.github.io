This is a really fun set of interviews by theater historian Max Wilk
with some of the greatest songwriters in American history; some wrote
popular songs, some wrote for the theater, most did both.  Long and
personal interviews with  Rodgers and Hart, Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer,
Irving Berlin, the Gershwins, Comden and Green, Yip Harburg, Frank
Loesser, Dorothy Fields, and others.

It was published in 1973, and a lot has happened since then, but it's
a great snapshot at a time when all these folks were still alive and
able to be interviewed.

Among my favorite quotes/excerpts from some of the interviews:

_Johnny  Mercer:_  What you _do_ know, though, is, it's got to be
different. It can't be just another damn show. There are so many of
those. Almost all the shows that come into town are not original,
they're all like something else.  And I---well, this will sound
conceited to you, but I just don't want to write _Hello, Dolly!_  I
think it's a dreary show. _West Side Story_ was a strong show, or
_[The] King and I_. That'd be the kind of show I'd like to write, one
that has some substance, with a lot of original ideas and great songs.
(p. 147)

_Jule Styne:_ In some strange way, all the guys that have made their
way in the musical theatre as composers are _dramatists_, because they
have given the character. When you can give characterization, you are
a dramatist. So I was growing up with this all the time, layer upon
layer of know-how, and then came _Gypsy_. Of course, that was the
biggest kind of landmark that ever was for me. I became the superb
dramatist out of that because, GOd, I mean, to me that was like
_Traviata_---that first act, writing a thing like "Everything's Coming
Up Roses", which was so macabre, with this child thing, and the woman
crying, and all that. It was just unbelievable. It was, of course, one
of the greatest shows I have done.
(p. 176)

_Sammy Cahn_: Now, you ask which comes first, the words or the music?
I'll tell you which---_the money!_ Or the phone call---or the request!
Which we have. I go to the typewriter and I sit down with a piece of
yellow paper which is my work sheet. I look at it about two, three
minutes and I start to type. The title. "Three coins in the fountain,
each one seeking happiness. Thrown by three hopeful lovers, which one
will the fountain bless?" That took me two or three minutes to
type. Now, as simple as it sounds, it is the result of twenty years of
lyric writing.
(p. 198)

A great read for any musical theater person who's also curious about
its intersection with popular songwriting (which is, of course, one of
its roots, but some younger folks like us tend to forget about that,
since in the 1960s popular music and theater music diverged).
