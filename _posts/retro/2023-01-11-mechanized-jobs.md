title: "Machines that took away jobs but I think it's OK"

Not long ago I got into an...interesting...conversation about machines
that took away jobs.  That's actually not the conversation I'd been
planning to have: I had watched a [cool
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxCha4Kez9c) on how the 
US Postal Service handles envelopes whose destination address cannot be OCR'd,
and in the process of explaining it to a friend, I pointed out (as the
video taught me) that 
a single "human powered" center with about 800 employees is sufficient
to deal with all such mail in a timely way.  Just 20 years ago there
were over 50 such
centers, giving a sense of how far OCR and ML have advanced beyond
when it became possible to OCR zip codes.

But my friend's surprising and rather deflating reaction was that that
"advance" had put a bunch of people out of work, and was that really
something to be happy about?

I was surprised by this reaction to say the least, not just because
that hadn't at all been the point of bringing it up, but because in
general I'm a proponent of _less paper mail overall_ in order to
reduce the consumption of paper and fossil fuels that that entails,
and this advance seemed compatible with that goal.  That is, yeah,
people did lose their jobs because of this, but I have no problem
defending the conclusion that the overall effects of the change
represented a net benefit to society.

And it's not as if those displaced workers represented
a major lost investment in training and experience: while the technology
they use does require some training, this isn't 
a craft apprenticeship where displacing a worker means tossing
out years of experience (oppose, for example, a weaver, woodworker, etc.).

And then today during a lunch break, because I enjoy watching videos
about how things work, I watched a great video about how [automatic
pin-setting machines in bowling alleys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iod6uwUGM2E) work...Guess
what---they displaced workers who were hired to hang around
behind the bowling lanes and manually reset pins after each frame!

Anyway, I got sufficiently irked about the whole thing that I thought to
compile a list of machines that nominally took away jobs but that
I'd challenge anyone to argue we aren't better off as a society for
it.  Perhaps if a Luddite argued against these, that makes me a
Dullite.

To limit the scope of my rant, I'm only including inventions that
completely eliminated a job category, rather than ones that just
diminished the number of people.  So by my own definition, the
automatic address recognition technology doesn't make the list, since
there are still people doing that job, just fewer of them.  Similarly
travel agents: many (most?) people now book travel directly online,
but there are still travel agents, just fewer of them and serving more
specialized markets.

Here are, in no particular order, some of the ones I thought of.

* [Automatic
pinsetters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iod6uwUGM2E). c. 1952.  **Displaced:**
about one "pinboy" (yes, that was a job title) per bowling lane in the country.

* Refrigerators (1834, although they wouldn't become popular
commercially until the 1920s and residentially until the 1960s in the
US).  **Displaced:** people who worked in the supply chain of ice
blocks, such as ice haulers.  Presumably they were then free to do
other things, such as not get permanent back injuries.

* Movies with sound (c. 1920).  **Displaced:** hundreds of live musicians who
would otherwise have provided the live musical accompaniment to silent
films.

* Record players and the associated recording
equipment. **Displaced:** Yes, we still have live performances, but I'm thinking here of Tin Pan
Alley "song pluggers," who would play sheet music in music stores so prospective
customers could see if they liked the song.  George Gershwin got his
start that way, but when they let him go, he found his way
to a new career, namely changing the face of American popular music.

* Cable cars.  (I live in San Francisco, where these are a thing.)
**Displaced:** horses and their drivers and keepers, though I imagine
they probably hired about the same number of cable car operators and
mechanics.  And of course the horses themselves were displaced, but
that beats their existing career path, which was to
be worked to death on some of the steepest urban streets in the
country.

* Direct dial telephone service (c. 1951 for US domestic, somewhat
later for direct-dial international long distance).
**Displaced:** telephone operators ("hello girls"), which was actually
a skilled position in which experience mattered.  But manually connecting every
call by physically patching together a continuous circuit would
probably not have scaled with the demand for phone service.

* Electronic databases for keeping client records, business records,
etc.  **Displaced:** people who did filing work.  But have you ever
done filing work?  It's spirit-crushing.  A special subcategory is
library card catalogs and circulation systems moving from manual
card-based implementations to electronic ones.

* Food processors.  **Displaced:**  If you've ever chopped, grated, diced, blended,
liquefied, pureed, and you **loved it**, you're someone who might have
been unhappy about these jobs being lost.
