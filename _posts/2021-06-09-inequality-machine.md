# Book summary: The Inequality MachineHow College Divides Us, by Paul Tough

Paul Tough writes about how college in the US has gone from being a
_tool for upward mobility_ to a _shield against downward mobility_, and at
the same time, colleges are employing survival strategies that further
divide the diploma-haves and diploma-have-nots. Essentially, college
is becoming more like a caste system, where the promise of "breaking
out" of your caste via a degree from a selective college is less and
less likely. He outlines a few patterns that explain why this is
happening and the effect it has on students.

(Note: for brevity I use "smart rich kids", "smart poor kids", etc. as
abbreviations for a more nuanced concept. They're not meant to be
flip, just to keep things terse.)

**Students who attend highly selective colleges are much more likely to
be wealthy as adults, regardless of their initial socioeconomic
standing.** That is, the experience of going to a selective college can
erase many socioeconomic disadvantages, although it is more
"life-changing" (in terms of likelihood of climbing the socioeconomic
ladder) for poor students. However, capable-but-poor students often
aren't going to selective colleges: elite schools are largely (over
2/3) populated by rich students, i.e. by those who will benefit the
least from the experience. Why is this and what problems does it cause
for poor students?

**The vicious cycle of standardized tests and admissions.** Caroline Hoxby
found that at selective colleges, the median SAT score correlates with
the amount those colleges spend per-student to educate them. Elite
colleges spend so much per student that they _lose money on every
student_ as a result. But attending a selective college also improves
your economic prospects, so the colleges are counting on those
students to be alumni donors later. At the same time, while the
official party line given by high school guidance counselors was that
any good college was fine and you should find the "best fit", students
were increasingly realizing that selective=$$$, so today's students
tend to go to the most selective college that will admit them. To do
so, they need high test scores, costly test prep, etc. This further
concentrates all the smart rich kids in a shrinking number of elite
institutions that must then spend lots of money on them to make sure
they will donate later—a vicious cycle.

But Hoxby also found (based on studying ACT/SAT scores) that poor
smart kids _weren't even applying to selective schools_ that they were
qualified for, and she hypothesized that they just didn't know the
ropes about discovering and applying to selective schools (including
things like knowing they could get fee waivers if they couldn't afford
to apply), or perhaps weren't confident of their success, because they
didn't have local role models to give them that information. Hoxby and
Sarah Turner devised an intervention: they randomly chose 10,000 poor
smart kids (based on SAT/ACT info) and sent each a folder with info
about applying to selective schools, sample fee waiver forms,
information about financial aid, and more. Students who received these
packets were 31% more likely to apply to selective schools and 19%
more likely to decide to attend, compared to a control group of
similarly poor and smart kids who _didn't_ receive a packet.

What about resources made available free to everyone to improve test
scores? Khan Academy has a free "official SAT test prep" program
anyone can use, but data scientists from Khan Academy and the College
Board found that even though each hour of time spent on the site had
an equal effect on score-boosting for all students, privileged
(primarily white and Asian) students spent two to three times as long
using the site as underprivileged students. UPenn social scientists
Angela Duckworth and Katherine Milkman had intended to try various
interventions to motivate the latter group to study more and develop
better habits, but were unable to get the needed data and
collaboration in time to do so; ultimately the study didn't get done.

**Fear of failure/fear of fitting in.** When smart poor kids do get into
an elite college, they often have no peer group because the kids
around them have been differently socialized. In particular, the rich
kids likely came from professional households where the value of
networking (with both peers and superiors, i.e. faculty) is well
understood; the poor kids often didn't, and some see fraternizing with
faculty or even forming peer study groups as an _admission of weakness_,
and that they should instead just work hard on their own and keep
their heads down. This causes 2 problems. First, students learn much
more and have better psychological support if they study in groups
vs. alone. Second, these students don't develop the networking skills
they will need in post-college careers.  Even when these students are
explicitly invited to join (eg) advising groups, they often don't
respond. The situation is exacerbated if the students are from groups
historically under-represented at that college or in that major.

**Ethnic diversity ≠ socioeconomic diversity.** Colleges like to boast
that they accept a lot of Pell students, but many game the system by
finding the students _closest_ to the Pell threshold. Thus, a student
who is qualified and _just below_ the Pell threshold is _ten times more
likely_ to be admitted than one who is equally qualified but just above
the Pell threshold. The result is that Pell numbers don't correlate
with socioeconomic diversity: instead you get a bimodal distribution,
with enough "barely Pell" kids to boost those numbers and a lot of
rich kids to subsidize them. (Extreme examples: in 2013, only 2% of
Princeton students came from the bottom 20% socioeconomically, whereas
17% of them came from top-1% families. In the same year, the median
family income of entering students at Trinity College that year was
$258,000. In 2018, the median family income at the University of
Alabama was higher than that at Bryn Mawr.) Using a similar trick,
colleges that admit students of color who immigrated voluntarily from
Africa or the Caribbean (who are more likely to have attended private
school, come from an intact 2-parent household, and have at least one
parent who is a college graduate, compared to students of color
descended from slaves) can hit an "ethnic diversity" target without
improving socioeconomic diversity.

Lauren Rivera, author of Pedigree, found that "elite" firms when
interviewing college grads are effectively screening for things that
correlate with parents' socioeconomic standing—that is, for _who the
student was when they applied to college_, not who they became by
graduation day. The rationale is that being accepted to a selective
university is a signal that you're smart and can learn fast and work
hard. How well you did _in college_ is less relevant, especially for
lucrative but entry-level jobs that don't require deep specialized
skills but _do_ require networking and schmoozing. Students from elite
schools who did extracurriculars (especially sports, and especially
sports with a high barrier to entry, like lacrosse) were judged
particularly desirable by this criterion. As a result, for a student
who comes to an elite university _not_ from that background, their
story/struggle (sometimes the very thing that brought them to the
attention of an admissions officer) is _not_ something they can talk
about, so they feel even more isolated.

**Financial aid.** To pay the bills, financial aid is often given to rich
kids who don't need it in order to get them to come, because even at a
discount, they will pay more of the bill than a poor student, and thus
help balance the books. The most desirable students from this
perspective are below-average academically but high-income: not so far
below average that they drag down US News rankings, but _enough_ below
average that your offer is probably the most selective they'll get, so
they'll be motivated to come. As a result, the richest colleges, which
can best afford to take lots of poor smart kids, take the fewest. As
one admissions officer said: “Admissions for us is not a matter of
turning down students we’d like to admit. It’s a matter of admitting
students we’d like to turn down.” His advice for improving the
situation? "quit paying so much attention to the SAT & ACT",
especially since test-prep and other $$$ strategies can "inflate" SAT
scores to where they are out of whack with a student's actual ability
(as demonstrated by their transcript, e.g.). When DePaul University (a
less selective school) stopped weighting the SAT so heavily but asked
students to voluntarily self-report their score _after_ admission, they
found that students who didn't report their scores on the application
did just as well as a group as those who did report their scores. That
is, low test scores are often a "false alarm". Family income predicts
SAT scores; it doesn't predict high school performance.

**A bright spot** is the UTexas system's "top 10%" rule, in which the top
10% of students from _any Texas high school_  are guaranteed UT admission. Yes,
some arrive less prepared for socioeconomic reasons, but support
systems are put in place to help them succeed in the same courses as
everyone else, rather than sending them to "remedial" classes. Some of
the support is psychological: when these students have difficulty,
remind them that it's because the material is hard, not because they
are "less fit" to be here. (Students from less-selective high schools
clearly see that their peers from more-selective high schools are
ahead when they get to college, but they take this as a signal that
they don't belong there.) _Students need to hear that "someone here is
looking out for me, someone wants me to succeed,"_ and sometimes the
support system has to be "focused and intrusive" to do this
effectively.

Upward mobility or a shield against downward mobility? Having a
Bachelors still commands a premium, but most of the increase in the
gap between degree and nondegree students comes from those who
_continued to advanced degrees_. The relative advantage of a
Bachelors-only has not changed since the 1970s. Corollary: we need to
invest more in other non-bachelors-degree pathways for those not
college-inclined who want to pursue economically secure careers that
don't necessarily benefit from a 4-year degree. And college is a
terrible investment if you don't complete your degree, as you end up
with debt but no premium. For-profit colleges are even worse, and
spend twice as much on marketing and recruitment per student as on
actual teaching. Yet they exist because "traditional" higher ed is
structured to exclude so many students, so for-profit education soaks
them up.
