Paul LeBlanc is the president of Southern New Hampshire University,
which famously reinvented itself with its "College for America"
program aimed at providing a degree pathway to working adults who had
some college credit but no degree.  It now serves more than 170K learners.

A unique feature of the program is that it is 100% competency-based
learning: you can get credit for things you already know (learned on
the job) but never took formal classes in, as long as you can
demonstrate the knowledge (competencies).

A bad grade on a test doesn't follow you through the course, and the
course isn't transcripted until you've demonstrated competency on
every learning goal.

A set of interviews SNHU conducted with low-income GenZ students of
color in the Los Angeles area repeatedly yielded the comment "I love
learning, but I hate school."  Ouch.

This book argues for much more pervasive adoption of CBE
(competency-based education) throughout
higher education: we don't let pilots fly a plane without proving they
can fly the simulator, and conversely, if they can handle the
simulator then we don't withhold a pilot license just because they
didn't take all the right classes, so why don't we do the same for all
degrees?

## The accursed credit-hour and letter grades

Like others before him, LeBlanc curses the credit-hour, which was
originally designed to track _faculty_ effort but has somehow become
the yardstick of student learning ("You took 120 credit-hours worth of
classes, therefore you should get a degree attesting to your
knowledge").  

Credit hours also present a bureaucratic obstacle because they're used
as the basis of financial aid decisions, grants, student loans, etc.:
if you're not "taking a certain number of credit-hours" you may not
qualify for certain kinds of assistance.  So creatively doing CBL
sometimes requires shoehorning things into a credit-hours mold.
Worse, since credit-hours are ill defined and not connected to
learner behavior, unscrupulous actors can game them (grade inflation,
credit-hour inflation, etc.) to exploit these systems.

And as many students can attest, the slightest administrative hiccup
can lead to crisis.  Miss a couple of weeks because your mom is sick?
Drop the course, you'll never catch up in time.   Owe $100 in admin
fees?  Can't enroll or access your transcripts 
to apply for jobs.  Job changed your shift and now you can't attend
the same English class?  Sorry, you need to drop it, and now you
don't have enough units to continue to qualify for financial aid, and
by the way since you dropped out pay us back the Pell money you've
already spent this semester.  For community college students, most of
whom are working adults (among Pell recipients, about half work more
than 20 hours a week), going through college is like being one flat
tire away from disaster.  This is why (he argues) proposal for free
college or student-debt forgiveness ultimately won't work: they don't
address the root causes for 40% of students who start a 4-year degree
not finishing within 6 years.

LeBlanc also argues (correctly, IMO) that in most courses, the
only thing grades tell you concretely is that A-students did better
than B-students and so on.  They don't attest to specific knowledge,
and in fact depending on how the overall score is weighted, they don't
even guarantee that the list of competencies demonstrated by an
A-student is a strict superset of that of a B-student.

And credit hours do nothing to recognize learning that happens outside
the confines of a traditional course.

One result of the meaninglessness of credit-hours and grades as
learning measures is the difficulty of transferring credit for courses
from outside your institution.  

A more pernicious result is that unlike several decades ago, a
college degree by itself is no longer a "signal" of competency trusted by
employers: just 11% of business leaders strongly agreed that college
graduates have the skills and competencies needed for their workplace.

In contrast, as Todd Rose points out in _The End of Average_:

<blockquote>
Bloom showed that when students were allowed a little flexibility in
the pace of their learning, the vast majority of students ended up
performing extremely well... These two insights--that speed does not equal
ability, and that there are no universally fast or slow learners--had
actually been recognized several decades before Bloom's pioneering study.
</blockquote>

## Distorted priorities, and equity

Public perception is that in exploring higher ed, students care about
competitive sports, a social life, and being perceived as elite/going
to a selective school.  (LeBlanc refers to this as the "faith-based"
view of higher ed: if a school has a large enough library, enough
faculty rock stars, and high-enough average entering SAT scores, what
comes out will be fine.)
In fact, major findings from the 2020 report
_American Priorities for Higher Education_ found that affordability,
flexibility, and workplace-relevant/applied learning (ideally in the
form of projects that reflect real-world examples) were students'
highest ranked priorities.  

These priorities correlate with social mobility.
Although I don't believe the C4A program started this way, there's a
strong equity argument for flexible learning.  If you're poor,
everything takes more time: getting around, staying on top of chores,
etc., and that all takes time away from learning because you have less
control of your time.  (Eric Brewer used to say about his work on
Technology Infrastructure for Emerging Regions that "it's expensive
being poor.")  SNHU is fully asynchronous and online.

## Towards CBE, and all about assessment

CBE basically says:

1. Enumerate what students must be able to _do_ (competencies) with
respect to some body of knowledge

2. Come up with reliable _assessments_ that concretely allow the
student to demonstrate they can actually do it.

#2 is hard because in traditional universities it is usually left to
the broad discretion of faculty who have no training in authoring
reliable and valid assessments.  (Check yourself: if you're an
assessment author, do you know what those terms mean?)

Indeed, demonstrating mastering through doing often requires assessing
the process instead of (or in addition to) the product.  (This is
true, e.g., in agile software engineering, where following the process
is just as important as creating the artifact, maybe more so.)
Because such things can be hard to assess, we often test what is easy
to assess, the equivalent of searching for lost keys under the
streetlamp because that's where the light is brightest.

In a CBE world, a course is a list of competencies, and the only
possible grades for each one are "Mastered" or "Not yet."  And
competencies may stack: demonstrating competency in a basic skill
(say, writing a loop) will be required often in doing more advanced
competencies, and so constantly re-exercised after mastery is
demonstrated (a form of "spiraling", a K-12 term about building
mastery over time).

In a CBE world, getting into college would be easy, but graduating
would be hard.  And getting into C4A _is_ easy--not in the sense that
they'll take just anyone, but they turn around enrollment inquiries in
a day, much more "customer focused" than traditional academia.

What about "soft skills"?  By age 40, social sceince/humanities
graduates have often closed the wage gap with STEM graduates because
technical skills can become obsolete and need to be refreshed often,
but "soft skills" don't.  (If you're a good  writer or team leader,
you just get better at it the more you do it.  If you're a good
Perl programmer...well...)  These can be assessed, albeit manually and
with a good rubric that clearly states the objective.  For example, a
Team Dynamics competency set might include:

* Describes some types of conflicts that could occur with difficult
employees and identifies how these might affect team communication

* Describes some ways to manage emotions when working with team
members

* Describes specific ways in which age and cultural factors will be
considered in helping the team work together effectively

...and so on.

**In the end, the "cultural" obstacles traditional academics must
overcome to embrace CBE are (a) recognizing that learning can happen
anywhere (not just in the classroom) and assessment doesn't depend on
how or where the learning happened, and (b) disaggregating faculty
responsibilities of mentoring, teaching courses, and assessing/evaluating,
possibly into different roles performed by different people.**  At
SNHU, "evaluators" hold advanced degrees and are there to provide
quick, personalized, _and anonymous_ feedback (kind of like a program
committee) on student work.  This setup minimizes biases and other
barriers (especially if the student's identity is also anonymous to
the assessor).  However, faculty can feel vulnerable if it seems like
this approach is reducing their centrality to higher education.

## Structural problems

In Community College and other settings, including Northern Arizona
University, scaling CBE was very difficult for various reasons.
Necessary administrative work (financial aid usually based on
credit-hours or full-time student status; enrollment management,
including assigning and resolving incomplete grades; etc.) had to be
done by hand.  Explaining CBE was challenging -- because it focuses on
assessment, they had to explain they were not "watering down" the
quality of instruction, just focusing the outcome metric on something
other than seat time.

## Microcredentials

There's a whole underlying question here (to me) about whether
*degrees* are even the right thing to discuss.  If the goal of
(certain sectors of) higher ed is to get you into the job market, why
wouldn't stackable skills-attesting certificates be just as good as
degrees?  Part of LeBlanc's answer is that many companies still use
degree-holding as a de facto placeholder/requirement for certain
opportunities (presumably because it *used* to be a useful signal).
But notably, SNHU has acquired at least one software bootcamp and
beefed up the bootcamp program to be "college level" (whatever that means),
meaning that those credits could be counted towards the
already-competency-based SNHU degree.
