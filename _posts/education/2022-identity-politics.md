The title of this post is mine, but it summarizes my frustration with
where we are in late 2022.  I see it at the university, I see it in
the world of theater, I see it all around us.  It's not "wokeness"
that's the problem: it's the recasting of many fairly conventional
(albeit justified) grievances and problems in the cloak of social
justice.

There were two articles in late 2022 that really hit the nail on the
head for me.

_Building Resilient Organizations_, by organizer/activist Maurice
Mitchell,
[appeared](https://forgeorganizing.org/article/building-resilient-organizations)
appeared in the newsletter of _The Forge_, whose mission is basically
helping advocacy groups get better at organizing their work.  He
argues that activist organizations fail to reach their potential
impact by falling into one or more of the following fallacies (you
might think of them as "the ten anti-commandments"): 

1. Neoliberal identity: the idea that your identity (racial, ethnic,
privileged, whatever) is sufficient to position you with respect
to ideas/ideology, leadership, or other mandate; for example, that
your identity as (say) a first-gen Latino is sufficient to categorize
how you will (or should) think, speak, or vote.

2. Maximalism: "Considering anything less than the most idealistic
position as a betrayal of core values and evidence of corruption,
cowardice, lack of commitment, or vision."  In a representative
democracy, change can be slow and comes in incremental steps.  (Ask
the pro-life supporters who, after 50 years, managed to achieve their
monumental goal of overturning Roe.)  And
when you're part of an advocacy organization, unless everyone in the
world is also part of your organization, there are by definition people
you need to bring into the tent.  You won't do that if your position
is to accept nothing less than immediate and complete conversion to
the most extreme statement of your position.  This particular fallacy
is pernicious and can birth the causes of internal implosion, as the
second article I read (see below) describes.

3. Anti-leadership attitude.  It's one thing to be skeptical of specific leaders
who have historically been guilty of corruption, abuse of authority,
and so on; but being skeptical of the _idea_ of leadership
or authority itself is self-destructive.  It is also patronizing in
that it assumes that participants in an activist movement are not
capable of, or do not aspire to, leadership practices to make the movement more
effective.

4. Anti-institutional sentiment.  Similarly, while many institutions
are historically blameworthy for many societal ills and
transgressions, the idea that institutions are _ipso facto_ a bad
thing just means you're crippling yourself by being unable to
institute (see what I did there?) best practices, discipline, and so
forth to further the cause.

5. Cherry-picking arguments: In other words, using loaded language when it suits you as a way of
shielding a line of argument from further scrutiny.
I can do no better here than to quote
Mitchell himself to give examples:

> Using incoherent or decontextualized arguments and perspectives to add perceived legitimacy to a position or oneself. For example, using the term “intersectionality” to, let's say, defend edits to a press statement. Or employing the Audre Lorde quote, “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence…,” to give gravitas to a desire to stay home from an action or take off time that you’ve earned and deserve as a worker. Or arming yourself with the concept “small is all” from adrienne maree brown’s Emergent Strategy framework—--outside of its global fractal context--—to resist taking responsibility for a larger scale intervention or growing your community group into a mass organization. 


6. Glass houses: insisting that change on a small scale (within a
group or organization, say) must be perfect and complete before
larger-scale change can begin, often by holding members of that group
to an unattainable standard that in practice just tears the group
apart.

7. The "small war": similarly, prioritizing the dynamics among members
of an organization over the organization's mission, impact, and
dynamic relative to the outside world.  

8. Unanchored care: the notion that it's the organization's
responsibility/onus to concern itself with all facets of care---harm,
burnout, stress, etc.---that one may experience through the work.
(This one also plays into the themes of the 2nd article below.)
No organization can (nor should be expected to) take on the work that is the domain of the
individual and their support network.

9. Disproportionality: essentially, blowing a problem out of
proportion (from which it's a small step to cloaking it in the garb of
social injustice).  For example, if any discomfort is not only
unacceptable but is called "violent," it becomes impossible to
describe acts that are truly violent.  If that discomfort is further
cast as (say) ageism, then we have no good way to talk about incidents
that truly represent ageism.

10.  Activist culture: acting on one's own personal and emotional
impulses rather than according to the mandate or agenda of
one's organization.  Doing this is really just a way to practice
activism without accountability, or to admit that one is unable to
periodically "sublimat[e] your impulse or ego for the greater good."

I note that it's possible to be a performative social justice "hashtag
crusader" while falling into _all_ of the above categories.  I've been
seeing it in community theater since the lockdown ended.
And when there's no face time among people, as occurred during the
lockdown, "social" media (I use the term distastefully and
reluctantly),
in which any single individual's voice can be amplified equally
loudly wihout concern for that individual's standing or credibility or
motivation,  becomes the one and only court of public opinion.

But that's a
subject for another post.  This post is in the "Education" category
because of the corrosive effects of the above pitfalls that I've seen
in the academy---certainly at my own workplace, UC Berkeley, though I
imagine other universities aren't far behind: 
the primary institutional mission of research and teaching has
taken a back seat to several of the above corrosive practices.

The above article is meant to inspire and empower organizations to do
better at achieving their goals of change.  The second article is more
investigative journalism. [Elephant in the Zoom: How Meltdowns Brought Progressive Groups to
a Standstill at a Critical Moment in World History,](https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture/),
by Ryan Grim writing in the mid-2022 issue of _The Intercept_, is a
critique of how so many progressive organizations have imploded (largely along
the exact fracture lines laid out by Mitchell) at precisely the
inflection point when their efforts would be most critical.

The opening anecdote in this long-form journalism piece concerns the
nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, the abortion rights movement's premier
data-gathering organization.  In the wake of the George Floyd murder,
Heather Boonstra, the organization's VP of public policy, surveyed her
staff to start a discussion about the role of systemic racism in
society and how Guttmacher's work could counter it.  But staff
responses focused not on the organization's mission, but on their own
grievances:

> Staff suggestions ... “includ[ed] loosening deadlines and
> implementing more proactive and explicit policies for leave without
> penalty”, ...  additional racial equity trainings, ...[and] that
> “Guttmacher do something tangible for Black employees in other
> divisions”  ... For Boonstra and others of her generation, the focus
> should have been on the work of the nonprofit: What could Guttmacher,
> with an annual budget of nearly $30 million, do now to make the world
> a better place? For her staff, that question had to be answered at
> home first: What could they do to make Guttmacher a better place? 

When Boonstra expressed frustration that she wanted to
focus on the organization's mission rather than workplace issues,
the staff was so appalled that the HR department and outside
counsel were brought in to investigate grievances of tokenization,
racism, and more.  The investigation concluded:
"Complaints were duly investigated and nothing raised [sic] to the level of
abuse or discrimination. Rather, what we saw was distrust,
disagreement, and discontent with management decisions they simply did
not like.”  As Ryan Grim writes:

> ...staff were ignoring the mission
> and focusing only on themselves, using a moment of public awakening to
> smuggle through standard grievances cloaked in the language of social
> justice.

I wonder what that's like.

The recent strike by teaching assistants and researchers echoes
some of these same points.  Some of the grievances and concerns of the strikers are
certainly legitimate.  But once those grievances are cast in the frame
of an adversarial and mutually mistrustful employer/employee
relationship, the mentor/apprentice collaboration that makes research
possible is destroyed.  This framing of the situation creates an
environment in which the institution's primary mission becomes
impossible to pursue.  (Personally, I predict that over medium timescales, the strikers' "victory"
will be a Pyrrhic one, but that's for another post.)

Grim describes a particular progression of events that can lead to
such scenarios.  A newly-invigorated group with an ambitious
social-change agenda finds that it is unable to achieve rapid and
widespread change overnight.  In recent high-profile cases, this is
often because their agenda or ideas are  too far outside the
["Overton window"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), the
notional range of policies or ideas that is politically acceptable to
a mainstream audience; American policy analyst Joseph Overton
postulated that this window slides gradually along a spectrum, but
an idea far outside the window at any given moment has little chance
of becoming policy in a democratic system.

Those individuals then feel disempowered or disenfranchised by their
perceived failure, so they turn to a situation where they _do_ have
power---the internal politics of the organizations within which they
work:

> Progressive organizations convened meetings to work through their
> response, and, like at Guttmacher, many of them left staff extremely
> unsatisfied. A looming sense of powerlessness on the left nudged the
> focus away from structural or wide-reaching change, which felt out of
> reach, and replaced it with an internal target that was more
> achievable. “Maybe I can’t end racism by myself, but I can get my
> manager fired, or I can get so and so removed, or I can hold somebody
> accountable,” one former executive director said. “People found power
> where they could, and often that’s where you work, sometimes where you
> live, or where you study, but someplace close to home.” 

This dynamic is toxic.  It causes organizations to collapse
internally because the power politics become more important than
upholding the mission.  It causes advocacy groups to fail to do their
work.  And, politically, it's happening at a time when the far right
has been carefully and systematically organizing in a disciplined way
for decades, gaining one small structural victory after another and
moving the tipping point closer and closer by degrees until we got to
where we are now: an insurrection against the government, the
trampling of reproductive rights, a resurgence in hate crimes and
domestic extremism, a deadly gun culture, and the silent complicity of
a certain political party when its candidates spew vile ethnic
insults and pathological  lies.

I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.

Oh, and Happy New Year!
