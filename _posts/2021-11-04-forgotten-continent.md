title: "The Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America"
categories: ["Book summary", ]
---

I found this book after some searching and review-reading, because I
was looking for a concise treatment of LatAm's history that would
answer the question: Why doesn't Latin America *work* economically?
Europe has long had the EEC, then the EC, then the EU and the
Eurozone; Southeast Asia has come from nowhere in the 1970s to a
combination of economic powerhouses (South Korea) and quite stable
countries you'd no longer call "developing" (Thailand); even eastern
Europe and some of the former Soviet states (the Baltics) have done
much better.
Yes, LatAm has had colonial exploitation and spells of military
authoritarianism, but so have those other regions, and LatAm is largely
unified by a common language, which isn't the case in any of the other
regions.

This book is written as a history, not as a treatise on the political
economics of LatAm, but I'll try to focus on the aspects of that
history that address my question.

## The state of LatAm in the 20th century

Notwithstanding episodes of authoritarianism and command
economies, all the evidence is that LatAms want what everyone
wants--basic freedoms, security, effective government that protects
their safety and property, and market conditions that create jobs,
opportunities, and social prosperity.
Many outsiders' view of LatAm is both anachronistic and somewhat
romanticized: poor/oppressed people trying to overcome decades of
colonialism who are easy prey for drug barons and military populists.
Western liberals are split between vicariously worshiping the Castros
and Chavezes as worthy solutions to LatAm's problems if only the
implementation were better, and failing to realize that weak states
foster both internal economic inequality and violent crime.

In fact, the typical 20th century LatAm citizen lives in a city with
access to both basic services and much more information about the
world than their parents.  In many countries, free and mostly honest
elections are now the norm, and citizens can aspire to material
progress.  


## Pre-20th century

The English who colonized the US came from an established
tradition of participatory, decentralized, parliamentary democracy.
The Spanish conquistadors brought Spain's militarized monarchical feudalism.
That model neither scales nor promotes economic growth: missives from the
king take months to get to the New World, and are ignored when they do
so because the state apparatus of force cannot effectively extend its
reach there, so local strongmen simply rule at their whim and arrogate
riches to themselves.
As well, life in many geographic areas of LatAm (eg the Andes) is
harsh, and the government's reach rarely extends there anyway, which
doesn't make them ripe for participatory government.

So when the colonies broke away, LatAm subjects didn't have a
democratic participatory model to follow; pre-conquistadors, they had
also been the subjects of empires, just smaller ones.
Once the conquistadors left, most of LatAm fell into a few decades of
rule by military strongmen.  The "modernists" or "reformers" bearing liberal European
ideas (the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, John Locke, Adam Smith)
were far from universally embraced by the people because they tended
to oppose things like communal land ownership, which had been part of
the fabric of pre-Columbian life.  In short, LatAm just wasn't ready
for those ideas, much as (IMO) Afghanistan wasn't ready to have a
Western-style democratic nation-state set up in 2002.

So that's LatAm history in a nutshell since the Spaniards left:
a push and pull between the rich and the poor,
between modernizers and conservatives, between democrats and authoritarians.

## Late 19th to early 20th century: a new liberalism

Liberalism in LatAm was somewhat resurgent in the late 19th c.,
spurred by the various [Revolutions of 1848 in
Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848), until
about the 1930s when it mutated into economic positivism, which holds
that the best government is one run scientifically by an intellectual
elite who know what is good for the people.  If that sounds like a
slippery slope from paternalism to corruption and authoritarianism, it
is.  It's not surprising that the pendulum would then swing towards
populist leaders, who were happy to advance the will of "the people",
just not through traditional democratic structures and only to the
extent it ultimately aligned with their own power-seeking.  **But the
more fundamental problem with populism is its
hostilility to property rights, which is incompatible
with a stable free market economy.**

## The Cold War

Before WW2, FDR's "good neighbor" policy limited US involvement in
LatAm, though sadly that meant the US also made no active effort to
promote democracy there.
After WW2 and the onset of the Cold War, LatAm was happy to line up
with the US against communism, but to the US it became more important for
governments to be overtly anti-communist than to be democratic, and
the US often failed to distinguish between socialist-leaning
nationalist reformers and actual communists, as when it crushed
democracy in Guatemala and effectively reinstated the corporatized
colonialism of United Fruit.  

Not surprisingly, this example simply
served to persuade left-wing elements that armed struggle was the only
way forward, and gave dictators such as Chile's Pinochet license to
say that extinguishing communism required suspending democracy since
it had clearly proved unworkable.
Just as the US overreached "fight communism" as "any
anti-communist government is preferable", revolutionaries such as
Castro focused not on establishing democracy but on extinguishing
imperialism.  (In fact Castro did not initially identify  as a
communist and concealed this intention until after the revolution.)
The combination of communism and authoritarianism turned Cuba into an
economic dependent of the Soviet Union; neoliberals worldwide thought
the fall of the Soviet Union would lead 
to reform in Cuba and elsewhere  (eg Fukuyama's *The End of History and the Last
Man*), but instead it became a dependent of China
and then of Chavez's Venezuela, with the result that today Cuba is
economically worse off than much of LatAm but less free.
Part of the repertoire of hypernationalism was to turn its back on the
global economy just when that was taking off; LatAm's global exports
as a fraction of GDP fell between 1965 and the 1970s.  Its new
industries were extractive, relying on imports of industrial machinery
and exports of non-price-dense goods and commodities (especially oil) with fluctuating
prices, a blueprint that is the opposite of what an economy needs to establish
itself through import substitution (as explained in [Jane Jacobs's *The
Economy of Cities*]({% post_url 2021-09-30-economy-cities %})).
Where Southeast Asian governments responded to the oil shocks of the
1970s by redoubling their attention on exports and globalization,
LatAm tried currency stabilization/devaluation and other macroeconomic
controls that work poorly in a globalized economy and ultimately.


Nonetheless, Castro's example inspired other LatAm revolutionaries,
including in Mexico; to which the US's default posture was "prevent
another Cuba".  (That stance led to the disaster in Nicaragua in
1979.) After the blood-soaked 1960s and 1970s, the left reevaluated
their love affair with this approach and came to value civil liberties
and a globalized free-market economy.  And it had become clear that
dictatorships, despite their ability to act by fiat, had been no more
successful in bringing economic stability than anyone else.  State
macroeconomic intervention and protectionism don't make for a stable
economy, no matter who is implementing them.  

Argentina was the
ultimate example of this.  In the late 1990s, an exodus from
developing economies began, starting with the devaluation of the Thai
baht in 1997.  To prevent currency value fluctuation, Argentina pegged their peso to the dollar,
which killed their exports, since their largest trading partner,
Brazil, couldn't afford them anymore; then they froze withdrawals,
essentially impoverishing people by suddenly making their saved money
effectively illiquid.  The only way out was forced deflation, to drive
nominal prices back down, but that is politically very difficult.
What was needed was to re-attract outside investment
