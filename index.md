Greetings!  I'm a Professor of Computer Science, Diversity & Equity Officer/Adviser at multiple levels (EECS Department, College of Engineering, University), and Faculty Adviser for Digital Learning Strategy.  I'm also a musical theater fanatic and performer, and an aficionado of computing history and retro technology.

The menu above leads to more detail about my various activities, but in a nutshell:

* My current research focuses on CS education and technology-enhanced learning, at the intersection of pedagogy, human-computer interaction, and programming systems.

* I regularly teach [CS169A Intro to Software Engineering](cs169a.cs169.org) (and the accompanying [CS169L project course](cs169l.cs169.org)), CS375 [Teaching Techniques for CS](cs375.org), and sometimes the freshman seminar [Our Digital Quandary](digitalquandary.org), exploring issues at the intersection of computer science and society.

# News

* July 1, 2022: Great [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/30/how-berkeley-engineering-launched-three-black-aau-presidents) from Inside Higher Ed on how Berkeley Engineering launched three Black college presidents...but also a separate sobering article from Chronicle of Higher Ed profiling five professors of color who [left academia because of the poor climate at their institutions](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-they-left).

* May 24, 2022: The NSF-funded LEAP Alliance is
[recognized](https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/how-the-original-leap-alliance-advocates-increase-diversity-of-doctoral-programs-in-computing/)
for its efforts to improve diversity & equity in the computing
professoriate!  Audrey Sillers and I represent Berkeley in this
important effort.

* May 13, 2022: [Prof. Dan Garcia](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia) and I were
awarded a grant from the [California Education Learning
Lab](calearninglab.org) for our project **A's for All**, promoting
proficiency-based/mastery-based learning.  It's a collaboration with
Cal State Long Beach and El Camino College.  Read more about it on the [LEARNER
Center](learner.berkeley.edu) website.
