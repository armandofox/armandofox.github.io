Greetings!  I'm a Professor of Computer Science, Diversity & Equity Officer/Adviser at multiple levels (EECS Department, College of Engineering, University), and Faculty Adviser for Digital Learning Strategy.  I'm also a musical theater fanatic and performer, and an aficionado of computing history and retro technology.

The menu above leads to more detail about my various activities, but in a nutshell:

* My current research focuses on CS education and technology-enhanced learning, at the intersection of pedagogy, human-computer interaction, and programming systems.

*  I regularly teach [CS169A Intro to Software Engineering](cs169a.cs169.org) (and the accompanying [CS169L project course](cs169l.cs169.org)), CS375 [Teaching Techniques for CS](cs375.org), and sometimes the freshman seminar [Our Digital Quandary](digitalquandary.org), exploring issues at the intersection of computer science and society.
