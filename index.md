![Armando at Machu Picchu, 2014](/assets/img/machupicchu.jpg){:align="right"}
Greetings!  I'm a Professor of Computer Science, and Diversity & Equity Officer/Adviser at multiple levels (EECS Department, College of Engineering, University).  I'm also a musical theater fanatic and performer, and an aficionado of computing history and retro technology.

My research focuses on CS education and technology-enhanced learning, at the intersection of pedagogy, human-computer interaction, and programming systems.

Courses I regularly teach:

* [CS169A Intro to Software Engineering](cs169a.cs169.org) (and the accompanying [CS169L project
course](cs169l.cs169.org)), often co-taught with Michael Ball
* [STAR Assesssments For Mastery
Learning](eecs.link/star) (with Dan Garcia and Narges Norouzi)
* [CS375 Teaching Techniques for CS](cs375.org)
* Sometimes, the freshman seminar [Our Digital Quandary](digitalquandary.org), exploring issues at the intersection of computer science and society.
