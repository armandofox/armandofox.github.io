![Armando at Machu Picchu, 2014](/assets/img/machupicchu.jpg){:align="right"}
Greetings!  I'm a Professor of Computer Science, Diversity & Equity Officer/Adviser at multiple levels (EECS Department, College of Engineering, University), and Faculty Adviser for Digital Learning Strategy.  I'm also a musical theater fanatic and performer, and an aficionado of computing history and retro technology.

The menu above leads to more detail about my various activities, but in a nutshell:

* My current research focuses on CS education and technology-enhanced learning, at the intersection of pedagogy, human-computer interaction, and programming systems.

* I regularly teach [CS169A Intro to Software Engineering](cs169a.cs169.org) (and the accompanying [CS169L project course](cs169l.cs169.org)), CS375 [Teaching Techniques for CS](cs375.org), and sometimes the freshman seminar [Our Digital Quandary](digitalquandary.org), exploring issues at the intersection of computer science and society.

# Media appearances, podcasts, etc.

* [Mediums, Media, and more: How storage plays a role in defining the
tech that made
us](https://www.techcentral.ie/mediums-media-and-more-with-prof-armando-fox/).

# News

* April 1, 2023: Victor Huang and I presented a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569826) at SIGCSE
2023 on our changes to [CS 375](cs375.org), the CS pedagogy course required of all
first-time EECS GSIs.  From the abstract: "Our view is that there is no
meaningful separation between pedagogical and climate skills: rather
than `compartmentalizing' climate into specific workshops or modules
of a course, our semester-long required TA preparation course treats
classroom climate as a lens through which traditional pedagogical
skills are viewed, such as giving presentations that encourage
participation, creating equitable assessments, and creating successful
student groups by fostering belonging."

* January 23, 2023: It's great to be back at in-person 
events again, having great discussions about software engineering education at [FISEE
2023](https://www.laser-foundation.org/fisee/2023/), where I gave an
[invited keynote](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10clYQn9ka0Q2NZIWY0eqAXqpA7P1UAoe) bringing together many of our research efforts over
the past few years in
teaching both technical and team skills in upper-division
project-based software engineering.

* July 1, 2022: Great [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/30/how-berkeley-engineering-launched-three-black-aau-presidents) from Inside Higher Ed on how Berkeley Engineering launched three Black college presidents...but also a separate sobering article from Chronicle of Higher Ed profiling five professors of color who [left academia because of the poor climate at their institutions](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-they-left).

* May 24, 2022: The NSF-funded LEAP Alliance is
[recognized](https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/how-the-original-leap-alliance-advocates-increase-diversity-of-doctoral-programs-in-computing/)
for its efforts to improve diversity & equity in the computing
professoriate!  Audrey Sillers and I represent Berkeley in this
important effort.

* May 13, 2022: [Prof. Dan Garcia](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia) and I were
awarded a grant from the [California Education Learning
Lab](calearninglab.org) for our project **A's for All**, promoting
proficiency-based/mastery-based learning.  It's a collaboration with
Cal State Long Beach and El Camino College.  Read more about it on the [LEARNER
Center](learner.berkeley.edu) website.
