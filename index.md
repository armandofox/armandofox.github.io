![Armando at Machu Picchu, 2014](/assets/img/machupicchu.jpg){:align="right"}
Greetings!  I'm a Professor of Computer Science, Diversity & Equity Officer/Adviser at multiple levels (EECS Department, College of Engineering, University), and Faculty Adviser for Digital Learning Strategy.  I'm also a musical theater fanatic and performer, and an aficionado of computing history and retro technology.

The menu above leads to more detail about my various activities, but in a nutshell:

* My current research focuses on CS education and technology-enhanced learning, at the intersection of pedagogy, human-computer interaction, and programming systems.

* I regularly teach [CS169A Intro to Software Engineering](cs169a.cs169.org) (and the accompanying [CS169L project course](cs169l.cs169.org)), CS375 [Teaching Techniques for CS](cs375.org), and sometimes the freshman seminar [Our Digital Quandary](digitalquandary.org), exploring issues at the intersection of computer science and society.

* Open office hours Fall 2023: Mondays 13:00-14:00 in 569 Soda Hall
(ring bell for entry to SLICE lab)

### Note: I will be out of town Sep 25-Oct 3 at Northwestern, UIUC, and the edX Global Forum.

# News

* May 5, 2023: I was a [panelist]() on the topic of "networked learning" (basically,
[SPOCs](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/spocs-small-private-online-classes-may-be-better-than-moocs.html))
at the [Leveling the Learning Curve](https://leveling.college) event
at Columbia University.  Lots of great conversations with academic and
industry leaders about higher ed, and a chance to articulate our
vision of how digital learning technology can [foster mastery learning](https://ace-lab.berkeley.edu/projects/cbt).

* May 1, 2023: The [final report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3Whcf5-JgF9wcmuj9jVWVLcZjR5zuOq/view?usp=sharing) from our pilot project on mastery
learning is available.  Our approach combines parameterized randomized
question generators (using UIUC's excellent
[PrairieLearn](prairielearn.org) authoring system) and a radical
approach to flexible deadlines (which we're developing further in our
[Flextensions](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/) project).  A key finding is that **while mastery
learning benefited all students in CS10, women and minoritized
students benefited relatively  more**, with the performance gap for
those students shrinking significantly since adopting our approach.

* April 1, 2023: Victor Huang and I presented a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569826) at SIGCSE
2023 on our changes to [CS 375](cs375.org), the CS pedagogy course required of all
first-time EECS GSIs.  From the abstract: "Our view is that there is no
meaningful separation between pedagogical and climate skills: rather
than `compartmentalizing' climate into specific workshops or modules
of a course, our semester-long required TA preparation course treats
classroom climate as a lens through which traditional pedagogical
skills are viewed, such as giving presentations that encourage
participation, creating equitable assessments, and creating successful
student groups by fostering belonging."

* January 23, 2023: It's great to be back at in-person 
events again, having great discussions about software engineering education at [FISEE
2023](https://www.laser-foundation.org/fisee/2023/), where I gave an
[invited keynote](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10clYQn9ka0Q2NZIWY0eqAXqpA7P1UAoe) bringing together many of our research efforts over
the past few years in
teaching both technical and team skills in upper-division
project-based software engineering.

* July 1, 2022: Great [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/30/how-berkeley-engineering-launched-three-black-aau-presidents) from Inside Higher Ed on how Berkeley Engineering launched three Black college presidents...but also a separate sobering article from Chronicle of Higher Ed profiling five professors of color who [left academia because of the poor climate at their institutions](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-they-left).

* May 24, 2022: The NSF-funded LEAP Alliance is
[recognized](https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/how-the-original-leap-alliance-advocates-increase-diversity-of-doctoral-programs-in-computing/)
for its efforts to improve diversity & equity in the computing
professoriate!  Audrey Sillers and I represent Berkeley in this
important effort.
