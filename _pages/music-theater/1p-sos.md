In August-September 2023 I had the privilege of music directing
_Sondheim On Sondheim_ at the Contra Costa Civic Theatre under the
direction of Marilyn Langbehn.  More than just a revue of Sondheim's
songs (from the iconic to the incredibly obscure), it's interspersed
with interviews in which Sondheim explains the gestation and genesis
of many of the songs. (Here's a [teaser clip from one of our
rehearsals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNE445nwAC8), and [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpwXdbMNkSk).)

(And an unauthorized recording of my awesome pit playing the [exit
music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkQRLX0Hok).  The
orchestrations for this show are gnarly and are all original by
Michael Starobin, who orchestrated _Sunday In the Park With George_ too.)

Since a number of friends have asked, here is a complete list of the
songs in the show, which shows they were written for, and other
curious minutiae:



The **Overture** references (in this order):

- the overture from _Merrily We Roll Along_
- the opening of _Follies (That Old Piano Roll,_ a song cut from the show)
- the opening of _Company_
- _Lovely_ from _A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum_
- The title song and _Hello Little Girl_ from _Into the Woods_
- _Epiphany_ from _Sweeney Todd_
- _Broadway Baby_ from _Follies_
- The title song from _Merrily We Roll Along_
- The end of _A Weekend in the Country_ from _A Little Night Music_

**Invocation/Forget War** was the original opening of _Forum._ It was replaced by **Love Is In the Air**, which was replaced by **Comedy Tonight**_._ Parts of _Invocation_ were later used in _The Frogs_.

**Take Me To the World** was written for the film _Evening Primrose._

**So Many People** is from _Saturday Night_.

**Something's Coming** is from _West Side Story_ (music by Leonard Bernstein).

**You Could Drive a Person Crazy** is from _Company._

**The Wedding is Off** was written for _Company_ but replaced with _Getting Married Today._

**Now You Know, Franklin Shepard Inc.,** and **Good Thing Going** are from _Merrily We Roll Along._

**Waiting For the Girls Upstairs** is from _Follies._

**Epiphany** is from _Sweeney Todd._

**I Read, Is This What You Call Love, Loving You,** and **Happiness** are from _Passion._

The Act I finale includes parts of Ever After _(Into the Woods_ Act I finale), A Weekend In the Country _(A Little Night Music_ Act I finale), and Sunday _(Sunday In the Park With George_ Act I finale).

**God** was self-deprecatingly written by Sondheim specifically for this show, possibly in response to a 1994 _New York Magazine_ article whose headline read “Is Sondheim God?”

**Losing My Mind** is from _Follies,_ and here it's part of a mash-up with **Not A Day Goes By** from _Merrily,_ whence also **Opening Doors.**

**The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened** is from _Road Show,_ the third incarnation of a show that started as _Wise Guys_ and evolved through _Bounce._ Its opening vamp also starts the opening numbers of those shows.

**Multitudes of Amys, Happily Ever After,** and **Being Alive** are three versions of the “I wish” song written for Bobby in _Company._

**Ah, But Underneath** is one of three songs written for Phyllis’s big production number near the end of _Follies_. (The other two are **Uptown/Downtown** and **The Story of Lucy and Jessie.**)

**In Buddy’s Eyes** is from _Follies._

**Something Just Broke** and **The Gun Song** are from _Assassins._

**Do I Hear a Waltz?** is from the musical of the same name (music by Richard Rodgers).

**Smile, Girls** was cut from _Gypsy_ after just one performance (music by Jule Styne).

**Finishing the Hat** and **Beautiful** are from _Sunday In the Park With George._

**Children Will Listen** is from _Into the Woods._

**Send In the Clowns** is, of course, from _A Little Night Music._

The Act II finale references **Company** (from _Company_), **Old Friends** (from _Merrily_), and **Anyone Can Whistle** (from _Anyone Can Whistle)._

The curtain call music reprises **That Old Piano Roll, Opening Doors, Broadway Baby,** the _Merrily_ overture, and **Take Me To the World.**
