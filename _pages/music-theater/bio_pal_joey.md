Armando Fox (Music Director; armandofox.com) has done over 20 shows in
20 years at Altarena, most recently Ruthless in 2023, and is always
happy to be back.  Indeed, some of the musicians in Pal Joey worked
with him on his very first Altarena show back in 2004 (Company)!  He's
also worked at CCCT, Custom Made Theatre Company, 42nd Street Moon,
and elsewhere, and has received numerous awards and nominations for
his music direction.  This is his second collaboration with Laura
Morgan.  As far as he knows, he's the author of the best book on music
direction written by a computer scientist
([pianoconductor.com](pianoconductor.com)) and the best computer
science textbook written by a music director
([saasbook.info](www.saasbook.info)).  By day he is a
computer science professor at UC Berkeley.
