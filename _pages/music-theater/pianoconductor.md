### Book: Piano/Conductor

|

Although I've had a good deal of formal training in piano performance, musicianship, theory, etc., like most Music Directors working in a nonprofessional setting I never received any formal training on how to do that.

It turns out there's a lot of non-obvious tasks in that job, and I wrote this book to pull them all together.

Although originally targeted at Music Directors, actors and singers
may find it useful too, since it contains a lot of the advice I give
when working with actors and singers on musical material--tips on how
to learn and practice tricky parts, how to think about character as it
relates to the music, how to polish away easily-avoided vocal
pitfalls, how to take care of your voice during the run of a show, and
so on.

The book focuses on the **dual role **of the modern MD or Associate
Conductor: sometimes you're leading the orchestra, sometimes you're a
rhythm instrument. And you have to work with the actors (some of whom
may also lack formal musical/vocal training) to help them learn often
challenging songs, while managing the rehearsal schedule, figuring out
which orchestra instruments you can do without, and so
on. Substantially all of the techniques are illustrated with examples
from the musical theater literature.



Below is the current Table of Contents. The book is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Piano-Conductor-Talked-Being-Director/dp/0984881298) in paperback (and soon Kindle) format, and it's sprinkled with whimsical illustrations by drummer and talented graphic artist Joanne Romeo.
