My one-hour presentation, featuring plenty of video and sound clips, gives a
brief introduction to the "Broadway musical":  What makes it different
from other art forms like a play or an opera?  Where, when, and how
did it originate?  What makes it a uniquely American invention?  What
were some of the milestones in its development?

(If you'd like me to give the talk at your organization, [contact
me.](mailto:theater@armandofox.com))

During the talk, I play excerpts from a number of musicals, and I've been asked
to put together a list of filmed or recorded performances of those for
which such recordings are available.

The links to movies are to IMDb, but I recommend using
[JustWatch](https://justwatch.com) to check which streaming service(s)
carry each title.

### Show Boat (1927), Oklahoma! (1943), South Pacific (1949)

_Book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein; music by Jerome Kern (Show Boat)
and Richard Rodgers (Oklahoma!, South Pacific)_

There are movie adaptations of these musicals, but I don't recommend
them.  They are nowhere near as compelling as the stage musicals.

There is a [2006 "staged concert" version of South
Pacific](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0798459/) performed by 
Reba McEntire, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Alec Baldwin, and others. The
singing is great, and the orchestra sounds terrific, but there are no
sets or scenery and there is minimal dialogue---it's really just about
the songs.

### West Side Story (1957)

_Music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by Arthur
Laurents, choreography by Jerome Robbins._

The original [1961 film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614)
starring Natalie Wood and Chita Rivera is still a classic and
overall very good, and is closest to the stage musical (though still
with a few important differences).  (See my [1-page
discussion](/1p-wss) of _West Side Story_.)

The new [2021 Spielberg-direct remake](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581652) takes a few liberties with the story and
casting, but in my view remains generally true to the material and is
a great film to watch.

**Audio Recordings:** There are many, but the 1957 original Broadway cast
album is probably the one to get.

### Company (1970)

_Music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by George Furth._

In shortened versions of the presentation, I don't mention this
landmark musical, which experimented with nonlinear storytelling.
There is a [filmed version of the 2001 Broadway production](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160997/) starring
Raul Esparza (dir. John Doyle) that is pretty good, although in
fairness this musical is so intimate that it'd be hard for _any_
filmed production to be as effective as seeing it live.

There is a 2011 [staged concert starring Neil Patrick
Harris](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942831) in the leading role.
Like the 2006 _South Pacific_ above, this is not a full production but
rather focuses on the songs.  That said, the orchestration and song
performance are (in my opinion) livelier and truer to the original
material than the 2001 John Doyle production.

**Audio Recordings:** My favorite is actually the 1995 West End revival
cast, but the original 1970 recording is excellent too.

### Ragtime (1997)

_Music by Stephen Flaherty, lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, book by Terrence McNally._

Unfortunately there's no filmed version of this monumental musical.
There is a movie based on the same E.L. Doctorow novel, but the movie
has very little in common with the musical (despite being more true to
the book).

**Audio Recordings:** The 1997 original Broadway cast album, featuring Brian
Stokes Mitchell and Audra McDonald, is outstanding.

### In the Heights (2008)

_Music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, book by Quiara Alegria Hudes._

The 2021 movie [In the Heights](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321510) is not a filmed performance of the
show, but an outstanding movie that is true to the material 
and features spectacular choreography---really a modern incarnation of the
"classic big-screen musical" from earlier times.

### Hamilton (2015)

_Book, music, and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda._

A [filmed live performance of
Hamilton](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8503618), excellently produced
and featuring the original Broadway cast, is
available on the Disney Plus channel and other streaming sources.

# Other musicals...

These musicals aren't mentioned in my presentation (except maybe in
passing) but are available as either high-qulaity filmed performances
or (in my opinion) excellent movie adaptations of their live
counterparts.

* [Gypsy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5375206) (1959), music by Jule
Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by Arthur Laurents.  A filmed
performance of the 2015
Savoy Theatre (UK) production is available for streaming on [Hoopla Digital](https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11708342).

* [Follies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7122350) (1970), music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by
James Goldman.  There is an excellent production by UK National
Theater but it doesn't yet seem to be available for streaming or on
DVD.
See my [1-page summary](/1p-follies) of _Follies._

* [Fiddler on the Roof](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093) (1965),
music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, book by Joe Stein.
There's no filmed performance that I know of, but the 1971 movie
starring Topol is excellent on its own merits and true to the stage play.

* [My Fair Lady](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058385) (1959), music
by Frederick Loewe, book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner.  The excellent
movie adaptation features some of the original cast, including Rex
Harrison and Stanley Holloway.

* [Sweeney Todd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084747) (1979), music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book
by Hugh Wheeler.  A filmed performance of the original Broadway cast,
starring the inimitable Angela Lansbury and George Hearn.  There is
also a [2006 movie adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236) starring Johnny Depp which is
surprisingly good for what it is, but varies in many ways from the
stage musical, which is the definitive versin.

* [Sunday In the Park With George](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092028) (1984), music and lyrics by
Stephen Sondheim, book by James Lapine.  Sondheim's most personal and
perhaps most nuanced work, and one of my all-time favorites, was
filmed during its  New York run starring Bernadette 
Peters and Mandy Patinkin.  See my [1-page summary](/1p-sunday) of _Sunday._

* [Into the Woods]() (1987), music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim,
book by James Lapine.  Filmed version of the original Broadway cast
starring Bernadette Peters.  I'm not as much a fan
of the 2020 movie adaptation.
