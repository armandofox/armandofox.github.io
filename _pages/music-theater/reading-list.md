Note that some of these articles may be behind paywalls...sorry.

# Writing music and lyrics for the theater

* _Lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II_.  Just what it says: a collection
of all his lyrics, with a foreword by Rodgers.  Lyrics aren't poetry because they
exist in time and go with music.  It's  interesting to
read the lyrics for how ineffective they are as poetry and yet how
very effective they are as lyrics.

* _Look, I Made a Hat_ and _Finishing the Hat_, by Stephen Sondheim

# Orchestration

* [Off the Stage, Whatâ€™s Behind the
Music](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/theater/17elli.html?unlocked_article_code=0mTWF2zXz43lLcFarTKa9fZDn7Exv-zo9JE0aIrLVWX2lRTkkcQ-rHeCB0LUAjD_aKn0pk15O-htj6yk4c3n5DT1Nw73DLlO0q8kUW2jylUhOG4BXhYzl-KSATx9BA6XfPQRloFheWoPyag4NRpWeImUtkS-4VOgUT-xvKG7DBnWUt-pOiwH8yZcLirty-P36pCrgPdYbWPNBuDryuI8ug7aa0XSRYk0sHjRtk2ZbnevjGxhjGWXGE5aoz4xbSqNeJNmlpvCfKlRxgkPX4dvwkkLQ9snsiePJ8IWv_MsiJ0PPk_BSfu9mYjmOEwsScpX&smid=url-share).
On orchestration, doing revivals with today's smaller orchestras, and more.
_The New York Times_, Aug. 13, 2008.

* [Music of the Night after Night after
Night](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/796/what-lies-beneath/act-one-5):
What life is like for the union musicians in _Phantom_, who've been
playing the exact same score every single night for decades.

* [The EGOT Winner Behind Sondheim's Signature
Sound](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/theater/jonathan-tunick-stephen-sondheim-broadway.html):
a short interview with Jonathan Tunick, maybe the best Broadway
orchestrator ever.

* _Instrumentally Speaking_ by Robert Russell Bennett.  Out of print
and almost impossible to find in libraries,
but it's possible I may have a PDF if you're interested.

* _The Sound of Broadway Music: A Book of Orchestrators and
Orchestration_, by Steve Suskind.  An encyclopedic, meticulously
researched tome of the Broadway orchestrator's art.  I thought I
actually knew something about the business of orchestration until I
read this.

* _The Contemporary Arranger_ by Don Sebesky.  If you do any actual
arranging, this needs to be on your bookshelf.  A reference (full of
examples and anti-examples) for  modern/jazz arranging, including
handling specialist instruments, writing for different size combos,
etc.

* _Sounds and Scores_ by Henry Mancini.  Hints on commercial
orchestration from one of the most successful composer/arrangers of
both popular and film music.
