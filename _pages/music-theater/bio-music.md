# Recent short bio (La Cage at Altarena)

Armando Fox (Music Director) is ecstatic to be back in the theater,
working with such a talented group on this joyful, affirming musical,
at a time when all of us could probably use some joy and affirmation!
A classically-trained musician and arranger, he has served as MD for
over 20 Bay Area musicals (including over a dozen at Altarena) since
2004, and has been a TBA and BATCC Finalist and BATCC Winner for Music
Direction.  His free book pianoconductor.com captures lessons
learned that might be useful to other MDs.  By day he is an
award-winning computer science professor at UC Berkeley.

# Full Music/Theater Bio

Armando Fox is a classically trained (since age 5) pianist who
completed pre-conservatory training at the Mannes College of Music,
New York (now part of the New School). There he studied piano
performance with Michael Boriskin and others, as well as music theory,
ear training, ensemble performance, choir, arranging, the whole
enchilada. He grew up in New York City and loves the theater; he’s
Music Directed about two dozen shows and played in pits for many
others. Other theater contributions include original orchestrations
for Ron Lytle’s Oh My Godmother! and workshop arrangements for The Man
Who Saved Christmas (which were replaced for the CD recording, so the
ones on the CD aren’t his work); ambitious reductions (usually to 6 or
fewer pieces) of Man of La Mancha, Merrily We Roll Along, Assassins,
and others; and additional original arrangements for Cabaret,
Assassins, and others. As far as he knows, he’s the author of the best
book on music direction written by a computer scientist and the best
computer science textbook written by a music director. He also plays
actual 80s vintage synthesizers in the 80s cover band Disposable Pop;
his previous cover bands, including Spoon and More at Eleven, have
been finalists in MIT’s Battle of the Bands, surely a distinction far
more prestigious than the Grammy Awards.
