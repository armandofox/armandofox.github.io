### Short Bio

Armando Fox (Music Director; armandofox.com) has done over 20 shows in
20 years at Altarena, most recently Ruthless in 2023, and is always
happy to be back.  Indeed, some of the musicians in Pal Joey worked
with him on his very first Altarena show back in 2004 (Company)!  He's
also worked at CCCT, Custom Made Theatre Company, 42nd Street Moon,
and elsewhere, and has received numerous awards and nominations for
his music direction.  This is his second collaboration with Laura
Morgan.  As far as he knows, he's the author of the best book on music
direction written by a computer scientist
([pianoconductor.com](pianoconductor.com)) and the best computer
science textbook written by a music director
([saasbook.info](www.saasbook.info)).  By day he is a
computer science professor at UC Berkeley.

## Full Bio

Armando Fox is a classically trained (since age 5) pianist who
completed pre-conservatory training at the Mannes College of Music,
New York (now part of the New School). There he studied piano
performance with [Michael

well as music theory, ear training, ensemble performance, choir,
arranging, the whole enchilada. He grew up in New York City and loves
the theater; he's Music Directed about two dozen shows and played in
pits for many others. Other theater contributions include
original [orchestrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OqIIJURIls) for
Ron Lytle's *[Oh My Godmother!](http://ohmygodmother.com/) *and
workshop arrangements for *[The Man Who Saved
Christmas](http://themanwhosavedchristmas.com/) *(which were replaced
for the CD recording, so the ones on the CD aren't his
work)*; *ambitious reductions (usually to 6 or fewer pieces) of *Man
of La Mancha, Merrily We Roll Along, Assassins, *and others; and
additional original arrangements for *Cabaret, Assassins, *and
others. As far as he knows, he's the author of the best [book on music
direction](http://pianoconductor.com/) written by a computer scientist
and the best [computer science
textbook](http://saasbook.info/) written by a music director. He also
plays actual 80s vintage synthesizers in the 80s cover
band *[Disposable Pop](http://disposablepop.com/); *his previous cover
bands, including *Spoon *and *More at Eleven, *have been finalists in
MIT's Battle of the Bands, surely a distinction far more prestigious
than the Grammy Awards.
