### Short Bio (from Altarena *Guys & Dolls* program)

Armando Fox (Music Director) is excited to be part of this great
creative team in his first Moon production.  He's served as Music
Director for dozens of Bay Area shows, including Altarena Playhouse's
recent production of La Cage Aux Folles, CCCT's In The Heights (TBA
Finalist, Music Direction), and Custom Made Theatre's Chess (BATCC
winner, Music Direction), Next to Normal (BATCC finalist, Music
Direction), and Assassins (TBA Top Ten, All Bay Area).  
He enjoys playing actual 80s vintage synthesizers in the 80s cover
band Disposable Pop, currently on COVID hiatus.  As far as he knows,
he's the author of the best book on music direction written by a
computer scientist (pianoconductor.com) and the best book on software
engineering written by a music director (saasbook.info).  In his day
job, he is an award-winning computer science professor at UC Berkeley.

## Full Bio

Armando Fox is a classically trained (since age 5) pianist who
completed pre-conservatory training at the Mannes College of Music,
New York (now part of the New School). There he studied piano
performance with [Michael
Boriskin](https://www.facebook.com/MichaelBoriskin/) and others, as
well as music theory, ear training, ensemble performance, choir,
arranging, the whole enchilada. He grew up in New York City and loves
the theater; he's Music Directed about two dozen shows and played in
pits for many others. Other theater contributions include
original [orchestrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OqIIJURIls) for
Ron Lytle's *[Oh My Godmother!](http://ohmygodmother.com/) *and
workshop arrangements for *[The Man Who Saved
Christmas](http://themanwhosavedchristmas.com/) *(which were replaced
for the CD recording, so the ones on the CD aren't his
work)*; *ambitious reductions (usually to 6 or fewer pieces) of *Man
of La Mancha, Merrily We Roll Along, Assassins, *and others; and
additional original arrangements for *Cabaret, Assassins, *and
others. As far as he knows, he's the author of the best [book on music
direction](http://pianoconductor.com/) written by a computer scientist
and the best [computer science
textbook](http://saasbook.info/) written by a music director. He also
plays actual 80s vintage synthesizers in the 80s cover
band *[Disposable Pop](http://disposablepop.com/); *his previous cover
bands, including *Spoon *and *More at Eleven, *have been finalists in
MIT's Battle of the Bands, surely a distinction far more prestigious
than the Grammy Awards.
