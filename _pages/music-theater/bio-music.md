### Short Bio

Armando Fox (Music Director; armandofox.com) is excited to return to CCCT, where he
had the joy of working on _In The Heights_ (TBA
Finalist, Music Direction) in the recent Before Times.
He's served as Music
Director for dozens of Bay Area shows, including 42nd Street Moon's
_The Pajama Game_, Altarena's
_La Cage Aux Folles_, Custom Made Theatre's Chess (BATCC
winner, Music Direction), Next to Normal (BATCC finalist, Music
Direction), Assassins (TBA Top Ten, All Bay Area), and lots more.
He enjoys playing 80s vintage synthesizers in his cover
band Disposable Pop (seeking a new
guitarist/vocalist...ask him if you're interested!) As far as he knows,
he's the author of the best book on music direction written by a
computer scientist ([pianoconductor.com](pianoconductor.com)) and the best book on software
engineering written by a music director ([saasbook.info](www.saasbook.info)).  In his day
job, he is an award-winning computer science professor at UC Berkeley.

## Full Bio

Armando Fox is a classically trained (since age 5) pianist who
completed pre-conservatory training at the Mannes College of Music,
New York (now part of the New School). There he studied piano
performance with [Michael
Boriskin](https://www.facebook.com/MichaelBoriskin/) and others, as
well as music theory, ear training, ensemble performance, choir,
arranging, the whole enchilada. He grew up in New York City and loves
the theater; he's Music Directed about two dozen shows and played in
pits for many others. Other theater contributions include
original [orchestrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OqIIJURIls) for
Ron Lytle's *[Oh My Godmother!](http://ohmygodmother.com/) *and
workshop arrangements for *[The Man Who Saved
Christmas](http://themanwhosavedchristmas.com/) *(which were replaced
for the CD recording, so the ones on the CD aren't his
work)*; *ambitious reductions (usually to 6 or fewer pieces) of *Man
of La Mancha, Merrily We Roll Along, Assassins, *and others; and
additional original arrangements for *Cabaret, Assassins, *and
others. As far as he knows, he's the author of the best [book on music
direction](http://pianoconductor.com/) written by a computer scientist
and the best [computer science
textbook](http://saasbook.info/) written by a music director. He also
plays actual 80s vintage synthesizers in the 80s cover
band *[Disposable Pop](http://disposablepop.com/); *his previous cover
bands, including *Spoon *and *More at Eleven, *have been finalists in
MIT's Battle of the Bands, surely a distinction far more prestigious
than the Grammy Awards.
