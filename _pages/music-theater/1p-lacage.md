[2022 Altarena Playhouse production](https://altarena.org) of this
musical, for which I served as Music Director._

_La Cage Aux Folles_ ("The Crazy Cage" or "The Cage of Crazies")
is a musicalized adaptation of the 1978
French comedy film of the same name,
with a book by actor/playwright/bookwriter Harvey Fierstein (author of
_Torch
Song Trilogy_, _Kinky Boots_, others; featured actor in _Torch Song Trilogy_,
_Independence Day_, _Mulan_, _Hairspray_, others) and a score by Jerry Herman
(_Hello, Dolly!_, _Mame_, many others).

# Premise

Albin, a drag performer in Saint Tropez in the 1980s, and Georges,
club owner and Albin's husband
of 20 years, have raised a son, Jean-Michel, born of a long-ago heterosexual
dalliance by Georges.
Young Jean-Michel has fallen
in love with Anne, the daughter of a homophobic politician who has
vowed to shut down all drag clubs.
Anne's family now wants to meet Jean-Michel's
parents before giving her permission to marry Jean-Michel.  The story
of how this
conflict unwinds and gets resolved is by turns hilariously funny,
poignant, and ultimately uplifting, and is complemented by a
highly memorable and 
rousing musical score. 

# "I Am What I Am"

A major theme that runs through the show is asserting one's
own identity and independence in the face of exclusion or oppression.
This theme is treated both lightly/comedically, as in the opening
number when the club dancers ("Les Cagelles"), 
a mixed group of drag queens and women, tell us:

<blockquote>
We are what we are, and what we are is an illusion.<br/>
We love how it feels, putting on heels, causing confusion.
</blockquote>

But they're just as quick to remind us that sometimes it can be really
hard to stand up and assert who you are, but you have to stand proud
and not let yourself be labelled by others:

<blockquote>
We face life, though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter.<br/>
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.<br/>
Look under our frocks: girdles and jocks, proving we are what we are.
</blockquote>

Later in the show, in a moment of personal crisis, the theme is
restated with more gravitas, as Zaza (the drag queen alter-ego of
Albin) takes over the song and changes the lyrics, resulting in one of
the most emotionally charged Act 1 finales in the literature:

<blockquote>
I am what I am, I don't want praise, I don't want pity.<br/>
I bang my own drum...Some think it's noise...I think it's pretty!<br/>
It's my world, that I want to have a little pride in.<br/>
My world&#8212;and it's not a place I have to hide in!<br/>
</blockquote>

Zaza/Albin moves from self-pity to anger and ultimately to pride and
defiance, _demanding_ that the world accept her just as she is: 

<blockquote>
Life's not worth a damn till you can say:<br/>
"Hey world, I am what I am!"
</blockquote>

_I Am What I Am_ is significant because most of Albin's solo numbers
to this point have been sung _as his alter-ego Zaza_, 
in whose skin Albin feels much more comfortable.
Here, Albin's own persona "takes over" the song
from Zaza as he asserts ownership of not only his alter ego, but his
pride in living his life in exactly that way.

# Cultural significance and the AIDS crisis

As I write this in 2022, the idea that you should be proud to claim
your own identity and speak in your own voice is part of the cultural
zeitgeist in the US, so the show's affirmation of that theme may not
seem particularly surprising to today's audiences.

But it's easy to overlook how brave this was when the musical first
appeared, in 1984.  As bookwriter Harvey Fierstein has said in various
interviews, queer people had long been a major force in musical
theater, and many musicals and plays had been written about them.  But
_La Cage_ was among the first to enjoy enormous commercial success,
putting the stories of queer people, _told by queer voices_, in front
of a _mainstream_ audience.  Even its creators were somewhat surprised
by its widespread appeal; it won Best Musical at that year's Tony
Awards (beating out Sondheim's _Sunday In the Park With George_).

Furthermore, at that time the AIDS crisis was in full force.
As Fierstein correctly noted, gay men were a disproportionately large
slice of the theater community, and the AIDS epidemic decimated that
group in particular.  At the same time, there was public hysteria and
misinformation about the contagiousness of AIDS, inaction to the point
of denial on the part of the Reagan
administration, and widespread anti-gay sentiment, just as we saw with
the irrational anti-Asian sentiment stoked by the
COVID-19 pandemic.  Ultimately, the federal government's inaction led to mobilization on
all sides, including the formation of the
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS campaign, which has since raised
tens of millions of dollars to support both AIDS research and
treatment for persons living with AIDS.
The situation also led to vociferous demand from the gay community and
others to take AIDS seriously and embark on 
the necessary research and clinical work to tackle it head on.

All in all, _La Cage_ is not just a great story full of heart, not just
an important milestone in LGBTQ+ theater history, 
but also a megaphone announcing an era in which LGBTQ+ people
would no longer simply "come out of the closet," but would instead demand the dignity
and respect to announce "I Am What I Am."
