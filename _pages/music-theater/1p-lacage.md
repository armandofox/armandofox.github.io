_NOTE: This 1-pager was originally prepared in conjunction with the
[2022 Altarena Playhouse production](https://altarena.org) of this
musical, for which I served as Music Director._

_La Cage_ is a musicalized adaptation of the 1978
French comedy film of the same name,
with a book by actor/playwright/bookwriter Harvey Fierstein (author of
_Torch
Song Trilogy_, _Kinky Boots_, others; featured actor in _Torch Song Trilogy_,
_Independence Day_, _Mulan_, _Hairspray_, others) and a score by Jerry Herman
(_Hello, Dolly!_, _Mame_, many others).

# Premise

Albin, a drag performer in Saint Tropez in the 1970s, and Georges,
club owner and Albin's husband
of 20 years, have raised a son, Jean-Michel, born of a long-ago heterosexual
dalliance by Georges.
Young Jean-Michel has fallen
in love with Anne, the daughter of a homophobic politician who has
vowed to shut down all drag clubs.
Anne's family now wants to meet Jean-Michel's
parents before giving her permission to marry Jean-Michel.  The story
of how this
conflict unwinds and gets resolved is by turns hilariously funny,
poignant, bitter, and ultimately uplifting, and is complemented by a
highly memorable and 
rousing musical score. 

# "I Am What I Am"

A major theme that runs through the show is asserting one's
own identity and independence in the face of exclusion or oppression.
This motif is treated both lightly/comedically, as in the opening
number when the drag club dancers ("Cagelles"), 
a mixed group of drag queens and women, tell us:

<blockquote>
We are what we are, and what we are is an illusion.
We love how it feels putting on heels, causing confusion.
</blockquote>

But they're just as quick to remind us that it is not always easy to
assert who you are:

<blockquote>
We face life, though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: girdles and jocks, proving we are what we are.
</blockquote>

Later in the show, in a moment of personal crisis, the theme is
restated with more gravitas, as Zaza (the drag queen alter-ego of
Albin) takes over the song and changes the lyrics, resulting in one of
the most emotionally charged Act 1 finales in the literature:

<blockquote>
I am what I am, I don't want praise, I don't want pity...
I bang my own drum...Some think it's noise...I think it's pretty!
It's my world, that I want to have a little pride in.
My world---and it's not a place I have to hide in!
</blockquote>

Zaza moves from self-pity to anger and ultimately to pride and
defiance, _demanding_ that the world accept her for who she is: 

<blockquote>
Life's not worth a damn till you can say, "Hey world, I am what I am!"
</blockquote>
"Your
life is a sham till you can shout out loud: I am what I am!"

_I Am What I Am_ is significant because most of Albin's solo numbers
to this point have been sung _as his alter-ego Zaza_, 
in whose skin Albin feels much more comfortable.
Here, Albin's own persona "takes over" the song
from Zaza as he asserts ownership of not only his alter ego, but his
pride in living his life in exactly that way.

# Cultural significance and the AIDS crisis

As Harvey Fierstein has said in an interview, when this musical
appeared in 1984, gay people had long been
a major force in musical theater, and many musicals and plays had been
written about them.  But _La Cage_ was among the first to enjoy
enormous commercial success, putting the stories
of gay people, _told by gay voices_, in front of a _mainstream_ audience.
Even its creators were somewhat surprised by its widespread appeal;
it won Best Musical at that year's Tony Awards (beating out
Sondheim's _Sunday In the Park With George_).

Nonetheless, its producers believe it would have been even more
successful had the AIDS crisis not been in full force at that time.
As Fierstein correctly noted, gay men were a disproportionately large
slice of the theater community, and the AIDS epidemic decimated that
group in particular.  At the same time, there was public hysteria and
misinformation about the contagiousness of AIDS, and inaction to the point
of denial on the part of the federal government and the Reagan
administration in particular.  This inaction led to mobilization on
all sides, including the formation of the
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS campaign, which has since raised
tens of millions of dollars to support both AIDS research and
treatment for persons living with AIDS, 
and to vociferous demand from the gay community and others to take AIDS seriously and embark on
the necessary research and clinical work to tackle it head on.

All in all, _La Cage_ is a great story, full of heart, and an
important milestone in LGBTQ+ history not only in the theatrical
sense, but as a megaphone announcing an era in which LGBTQ+ people
would not only "come out of the closet" but demand the dignity
and respect to announce "I Am What I Am."

I'm honored working alongside many members of that community,
including actors who are also professional drag performers in the Bay
Area, to help tell this story.
