With a book by actor/playwright/bookwriter Harvey Fierstein (book
writer, _Torch
Song Trilogy_, _Kinky Boots_, others; performer, _Torch Song Trilogy_,
_Independence Day_, _Mulan_, _Hairspray_, others) and a score by Jerry Herman
(_Hello, Dolly!_, _Mame_, many others), _La Cage_ is based on a 1970s
French comedy of the same name.  (An American film remake, _The Birdcage_
starring Robin Williams, was widely panned.)

The story's leading romantic couple are two married gay men who run
a drag club in Saint Tropez in the 70s; Albin is a drag performer
whose alter ego is the flamboyant Zaza, and Georges is Albin's devoted
husband of 20 years who more or less manages the club.

Albin and Georges have a son, Jean-Michel, from a heterosexual
dalliance by Georges before he met Albin.  The couple have raised
Jean-Michel as their own; Jean-Michel is firmly heterosexual, and
while he loves both his parents, he is sometimes uncomfortable with
Albin's/Zaza's mannerisms and flamboyance around his friends.

The conflict set up early in the show is that Jean-Michel has fallen
in love with the daughter of a very conservative politician who has
vowed to shut down all the drag clubs (and basically persecute
homosexuals), and Anne's family now wants to meet Jean-Michel's
parents before giving her permission to marry Jean-Michel.  How this
conflict unwinds and gets resolved is the storyline of the show.

# Cultural significance and the AIDS crisis

As Harvey Fierstein has said in an interview, when this musical
appeared in 1984, gay people had long been
a major force in musicals, and many musicals and plays had been
written about them.  But _La Cage_ was among the first to enjoy
spectacular and wide-ranging mainstream success, putting the stories
of gay people, told by gay voices, in front of a mainstream audience.
Even its creators were somewhat surprised by its widespread appeal.



# Identity: I Am What I Am

A major theme that runs throughout the show is one of asserting one's
own identity and independence.  In the very opening, we're introduced
to the nightclub dancers, the Cagelles, a mixed group of men in drag
and women, singing how "We Are What We Are",
but that it's not always easy to assert your identity:

<blockquote>
We are what we are, and what we are is an illusion.
We love how it feels putting on heels, causing confusion.
We face life, though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: girdles and jocks, proving we are what we are.
</blockquote>

Later in the show, in a moment of personal crisis, Zaza takes over the
song and changes the lyrics, resulting in one of the best Act 1 finale
anthems in the literature (in my opinion):

<blockquote>
I am what I am, I am my own special creation.
So, come take a look: give me the hook or the ovation.
It's my world, that I want to have a little pride in.
My world--and it's not a place I have to hide in!
Life's not worth a damn till you can say, "Hey world, I am what I am!"
</blockquote>

_I Am What I Am_ is significant because most of Albin's solo numbers
to this point have been sung _as Zaza_, and Albin has already revealed
to us in an earlier song that he's actually much more "comfortable in
his own skin" when he is performing as Zaza (_A Little More
Mascara_).  In this song, Albin's own persona "takes over" the song
from Zaza as he asserts ownership of not only his alter ego, but his
pride in living his life in exactly that way.
