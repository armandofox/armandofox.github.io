_La Cage_ is based on a 1970s
French comedy of the same name.  (An American film remake, _The Birdcage_
starring Robin Williams, was widely panned.)
The musical's book is by actor/playwright/bookwriter Harvey Fierstein (book
writer, _Torch
Song Trilogy_, _Kinky Boots_, others; performer, _Torch Song Trilogy_,
_Independence Day_, _Mulan_, _Hairspray_, others) and the  score is by Jerry Herman
(_Hello, Dolly!_, _Mame_, many others).

The story's leading romantic couple are two married gay men who run
a drag club in Saint Tropez in the 1970s; Albin is a drag performer
whose alter ego is the flamboyant Zaza, and Georges is Albin's devoted
husband of 20 years who manages the club.

Albin and Georges have raised a son, Jean-Michel, born of a heterosexual
dalliance by Georges before he married Albin.  Jean-Michel is firmly
heterosexual, and while he loves both his parents, he is sometimes
uncomfortable with Albin's/Zaza's mannerisms and flamboyance, and has
been bullied by others for it in the past.

Young Jean-Michel has fallen
in love with the daughter of a very conservative politician who has
vowed to shut down all the drag clubs (and basically persecute
homosexuals), and Anne's family now wants to meet Jean-Michel's
parents before giving her permission to marry Jean-Michel.  How this
conflict unwinds and gets resolved is the storyline of the show.

# Cultural significance and the AIDS crisis

As Harvey Fierstein has said in an interview, when this musical
appeared in 1984, gay people had long been
a major force in musicals, and many musicals and plays had been
written about them.  But _La Cage_ was among the first to enjoy
enormous mainstream success, putting the stories
of gay people, _told by gay voices_, in front of a mainstream audience.
Even its creators were somewhat surprised by its widespread appeal.

The musical won Best Musical at that year's Tony Awards (beating out
Sondheim's _Sunday In the Park With George_), and its producers
believe it would have been even more successful had the AIDS crisis
not been in full force at that time.  As Fierstein correctly noted,
gay men were a disproportionately large slice of the theater
community, and the AIDS epidemic decimated that group in particular.
There was public hysteria and misinformation about the contagiousness
of AIDS, mobilization on all sides (the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights
AIDS campaign was born, but there was plenty of homophobia to go
around as well), culminating in demands from the gay community and
others to take AIDS seriously and embark on vigorous research and
clinical work to address it head on.

# Them: I Am What I Am

A major theme that runs throughout the show is one of asserting one's
own identity and independence, especially in the face of oppression.
In the opening number, we're introduced to the nightclub dancers, the
Cagelles, a mixed group of men in drag and women, singing that "We Are
What We Are", but that it's not always easy to assert your identity:

<blockquote>
We are what we are, and what we are is an illusion.
We love how it feels putting on heels, causing confusion.
We face life, though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: girdles and jocks, proving we are what we are.
</blockquote>

Later in the show, in a moment of personal crisis, Zaza takes over the
song and changes the lyrics, resulting in one of the best Act 1 curtains
in the literature (in my opinion):

<blockquote>
I am what I am, I am my own special creation.
So, come take a look: give me the hook or the ovation.
It's my world, that I want to have a little pride in.
My world--and it's not a place I have to hide in!
Life's not worth a damn till you can say, "Hey world, I am what I am!"
</blockquote>

Zaza moves from hurt and self-pity, to anger, ultimately to pride and
defiance, _demanding_ that the world accept her for who she is: "Your
life is a sham till you can shout out loud: I am what I am!"

_I Am What I Am_ is significant because most of Albin's solo numbers
to this point have been sung _as Zaza_, and Albin has already revealed
to us in an earlier song that he's actually much more "comfortable in
his own skin" when he is performing as Zaza (_A Little More
Mascara_).  In this song, Albin's own persona "takes over" the song
from Zaza as he asserts ownership of not only his alter ego, but his
pride in living his life in exactly that way.
