Hi friends,

In October I had the great pleasure of performing [**Cantos De Mi
Tierra**](http://cantosdemitierra.com/), an
all-Spanish-language program of songs with four amazing Latinx singers
from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba.  The 1-hour show included
everything from traditional/folk music of those lands to
Shakira and Marc Anthony. 

The shows sold out immediately, and we've now been able to add two
more shows in January!  And because of my connection to LAGSES, the
organizers are making a limited number of discounted tickets available
for you all. 

Tickets are available for 
[Saturday 1/20 at 7pm](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/livemusic/1057788) and 
[Sunday 1/21 at 4pm](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/livemusic/1057789).

**We have set aside a _limited number_ of discounted tickets ($15
instead of $20)** 
specifically for LAGSES members.  If you'd like to purchase
discounted tickets, contact me directly for instructions.  Please note
they are nonrefundable and non-exchangeable.  

Our first 2 shows sold
out the same day, we added a third show and it sold out in 3 more
days, so i hope some of you can make it to one of the january shows! 

Here's a [short clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2782zx_LKw)
