# History & Governance

<dl class="quote">

  <dt>The past is never dead. It's not even past.</dt>
  <dd>William Faulker</dd>
  
  <dt>[The United Nations] was not created in order to bring us to
  heaven, but in order to save us from hell.
  </dt>
  <dd>Dag Hammarskjold, second secretary-general of the UN</dd>

  <dt>The future is dark, the present burdensome. Only the past, dead and
    finished, bears contemplation. Those who look upon it have survived
    it; they are its product and its victors. No wonder therefore that men
    concern themselves with history. </dt>
  <dd>G.R. Elton, <em>The Practice of
    History</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>In England and the United States, in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, in
    Switzerland and Canada, democracy is today sounder than ever
    before. It has defended itself with courage and energy against the
    assaults of foreign dictatorship, and has not yielded to dictatorship
    at home. But if war continues to absorb and dominate it, or if the
    itch to rule the world requires a large military establishment and
    appropriate, the freedoms of democracy may one by one succumb to the
    discipline of arms and strife. If race or class war divides us into
    hostile camps, changing political argument into blind hate, one side
    or the other may overturn the hustings with the rule of the sword. If
    our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as ably as it has
    created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man who can
    persuasively promise security for all; and a martial government, under
    whatever charming phrases, will engulf the democratic world.</dt>
  <dd>Will
    and Ariel Durant, <em>The Lessons of History</em>, writing in 1968
  </dd>

  <dt>The democratic will is vulgar; its laws, imperfect. I admit all
    this. But if it is true that soon there will be no middle way between
    the empire of democracy and the yoke of one man, ought we not try
    rather for the former than submit voluntarily to the latter? </dt>
  <dd>Alexis
    de Tocqueville, <em>Democracy In America, </em>quoted in Michael
    Reid, <em>Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those
  other forms that have been tried.</dt>
  <dd>Winston Churchill, though he attributed it to someone else</dd>
  
  <dt>
  As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more
  and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and
  glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's
  desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright
  moron. 
  </dt>
  <dd>
  H.L. Mencken
  </dd>


  <dt>When one hears about acts of extraordinary bravery in combat, it is
    usually a sign that the battle has not been going terribly well. For
    when wars unfold according to plan and one's own side is winning, acts
    of exceptional individual heroism are rarely called for. Bravery is
    required mostly by the desperate side. </dt>
  <dd>Guy Deutscher, <em>Through the
    Language Glass</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Civilization is a stream with banks. The stream is sometimes filled
    with blood from people killing, stealing, shouting and doing things
    historians usually record; while on the banks, unnoticed, people build
    homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write poetry and even
    whittle statues. The story of civilization is the story of what
    happened on the banks. Historians are pessimists because they ignore
    the banks of the river. </dt>
  <dd>Will and Ariel Durant, <em>The Story of
    Civilization</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Where a great proportion of the people are suffered to languish in
    helpless misery, that country must be ill-policed and wretchedly
    governed. Gentlemen of education, he observed, were pretty much
    the same in all countries; the condition of the lower orders, the poor
    especially, was the true mark of national discrimination.</dt>
  <dd>Boswell,
    <em>Life of Johnson</em>, quoted in Paul Theroux, <em>The Old Patagonian Express</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed
    killers besides. And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and
    massacres and missiles and irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties,
    whatever they may be worth; our symphonies, however seldom they may be
    played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted
    into battlefields; our dreams, however rarely they may be
    accomplished? The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how
    magnificently he has risen. </dt>
  <dd>Robert Ardrey, <em>African Genesis</em>, quoted in Michael Benson, <em>Space Odyssey:
    Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a
    Masterpiece</em>.
  </dd>

  <dt>If civilization is to mean anything, people have to acknowledge the
    humanity of their enemies.  </dt>
  <dd>John Hersey, author of <em>Hiroshima</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    You can always count on Americans to do the right thing, after
    they've tried everything else.
 </dt>
 <dd><em>apocryphally attributed to Winston Churchill</em></dd>

    Most people would sooner die than think. In fact, they do so.
  </dt>
  <dd>Bertrand Russell

  <dt>Education is what's left over after everything that has been learnt is
    forgotten.  </dt>
  <dd>James Bryan Conant, President of Harvard University
    from 1833--1853
  </dd>

  <dt>Man, unless he has experienced the influence of learning and
    philosophy, is subject to impulses worse than those of a wild
    beast. There is no beast more savage and dangerous than a human being
    who is swept along by the passions of ambition, greed, anger, envy,
    extravagance, and sensuality.  </dt>
  <dd>Erasmus
  </dd>

  <dt>
  There is no limit to the amount of nonsense you can think, if you
  think too long alone.

  </dt>
  <dd>Mark Twain

    comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and
    controversy. </dt>
  <dd>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
  </dd>

  <dt>Nothing is so necessary for a man as the company of intelligent
    women.  </dt>
  <dd>Leo Tolstoy
  </dd>


  <dt>Always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win
    unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself. </dt>
  <dd>Richard
    M. Nixon (farewell speech)
  </dd>

  <dt>Great people are those who make others feel that they, too, can become
    great.  </dt>
  <dd>Mark Twain
  </dd>

  <dt>If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. 
  </dt>
  <dd>Shirley Chisholm, first Black Congresswoman
  </dd>

  <dt>The thing that makes you exceptional, if you are at all, is inevitably
    that which must also make you lonely.  </dt>
  <dd>Lorraine Hansberry
  </dd>

  <dt>You seldom get what you pay for, but you never get what you don't pay
    for. </dt>
  <dd>Stanley Kubrick, quoted in Michael Benson's <em>Space Odyssey:
    Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece</em>

  <dt>He who seeks rest will find boredom; he who seeks work will find

  <dt>
    I have problems today that I did not have yesterday. I had problems

    ten cents.  </dt>
  <dd>George C. Tilyou, owner of Coney Island's Steeplechase
    Park, the day after it burned to the ground
  </dd>

<dt>
   We were speaking of the first steps along a path to which one could
affix the sign: <span style="font-size: 90%;">REASON IN THE SERVICE OF THE URGES.</span>
This because the overwhelming majority of the material products of the
mind were channeled into sybaritic pursuits. An ingeniously
constructed television set dispensed intellectual garbage;
sophisticated transportation technologies made it possible for a
degenerate, instead of getting soused in his own backyard, to dress up
a tourist and do the same in the vicinity of Saint Peter's
basilica. If this tendency were to lead to the invasion of the human
body by technological contrivances, undoubtedly the idea would be to
expand the gamut of pleasurable sensations to the maximum, and perhaps
even to bring into being&emdash;besides sex, narcotics, culinary
happiness&emdash;other, as yet unknown, kinds of sensual stimulation
and gratification.

# Religion & Philosophy

<dl class="quote">
  <dt>Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others,
    past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our
    future.  </dt>
  <dd>"The Revelation of Sonmi-451" from David Mitchell's
    novel <em>Cloud Atlas</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not
    become a monster. For when you look deep into the abyss, the abyss
    also looks into you.    </dt>
  <dd>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Pray: To ask that the laws of the universe be temporarily annulled in
    behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy. </dt>
  <dd>Ambrose
    Bierce, <em>The Devil's Dictionary</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the
    point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober
    one. </dt>
  <dd>George Bernard Shaw

  <dt>[Man is] the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts
    his throat if his theology isn't straight.  </dt>

  <dt>Only a Christian would think of our Buddha as 'just a man'. Our Buddha
    is a being which all men can become&emdash;something greater than
    himself&emdash;if he can overcome all his illusions. You cling to your
    illusions&emdash;and call them faith. 
    </dt>

  <dd>Franz Liszt, to his biographer</dd>

# City Life

<dl class="quote">
  <dt>A man of education cannot live among farmers in the country. The
    moment you leave the neighborhood of a city you are in the midst of
    barbarism. </dt>
  <dd>Sidney George Fisher (Philadelphia diarist), 1847
  </dd>

  <dt>They talk very loud, very fast, and altogether [sic]. If they ask you
    a question, before you can utter three words of your answer, they will
    break out upon you again, and talk away.</dt>

    dislike for New Yorkers, quoted in <em>The Address Book: What Street

  <dt>The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist where
    private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. Only
    where the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time
    absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time
    for the rights of the poor, can the beauties of Paris be realized. 
  </dt>
