# History & Governance

<dl class="quote">

  <dt>The future is dark, the present burdensome. Only the past, dead and
    finished, bears contemplation. Those who look upon it have survived
    it; they are its product and its victors. No wonder therefore that men
    concern themselves with history. </dt>
  <dd>G.R. Elton, <em>The Practice of
    History</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>In England and the United States, in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, in
    Switzerland and Canada, democracy is today sounder than ever
    before. It has defended itself with courage and energy against the
    assaults of foreign dictatorship, and has not yielded to dictatorship
    at home. But if war continues to absorb and dominate it, or if the
    itch to rule the world requires a large military establishment and
    appropriate, the freedoms of democracy may one by one succumb to the
    discipline of arms and strife. <em>If race or class war divides us into
    hostile camps, changing political argument into blind hate, one side
    or the other may overturn the hustings with the rule of the sword. If
    our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as ably as it has
    created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man who can
    persuasively promise security for all; and a martial government, under
    whatever charming phrases, will engulf the democratic world.</em></dt>
  <dd>Will
    and Ariel Durant, <em>The Lessons of History</em>, chapter X "History and
    Government" (emphasis added by me)
  </dd>

  <dt>The democratic will is vulgar; its laws, imperfect. I admit all
    this. But if it is true that soon there will be no middle way between
    the empire of democracy and the yoke of one man, ought we not try
    rather for the former than submit voluntarily to the latter? </dt>
  <dd>Alexis
    de Tocqueville, <em>Democracy In America, </em>quoted in Michael
    Reid, <em>Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>When one hears about acts of extraordinary bravery in combat, it is
    usually a sign that the battle has not been going terribly well. For
    when wars unfold according to plan and one's own side is winning, acts
    of exceptional individual heroism are rarely called for. Bravery is
    required mostly by the desperate side. </dt>
  <dd>Guy Deutscher, <em>Through the
    Language Glass</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Civilization is a stream with banks. The stream is sometimes filled
    with blood from people killing, stealing, shouting and doing things
    historians usually record; while on the banks, unnoticed, people build
    homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write poetry and even
    whittle statues. The story of civilization is the story of what
    happened on the banks. Historians are pessimists because they ignore
    the banks of the river. </dt>
  <dd>Will and Ariel Durant, <em>The Story of
    Civilization</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>Where a great proportion of the people are suffered to languish in
    helpless misery, that country must be ill-policed and wretchedly
    governed. </dt>
  <dd> Gentlemen of education, he observed, were pretty much
    the same in all countries; the condition of the lower orders, the poor
    especially, was the true mark of national discrimination. ---Boswell,
    Life of Johnson, quoted in Paul Theroux, <em>The Old Patagonian Express</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed
    killers besides. And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and
    massacres and missiles and irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties,
    whatever they may be worth; our symphonies, however seldom they may be
    played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted
    into battlefields; our dreams, however rarely they may be
    accomplished? The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how
    magnificently he has risen. </dt>
  <dd>Robert Ardrey, <em>African Genesis</em>, after
    the work of Raymond Dart, quoted in Michael Benson's <em>Space Odyssey:
    Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a
    Masterpiece</em>. [While "risen apes" is discredited, the essence of the
    quote rings true to me.]
  </dd>

  <dt>If civilization is to mean anything, people have to acknowledge the
    humanity of their enemies.  </dt>
  <dd>John Hersey, author of <em>Hiroshima</em>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    To watch the TV screen for any length of time is to learn some really
    frightening things about the American sense of reality. We are cruelly
    trapped between what we would like to be and what we actually are. And
    we cannot possibly become what we would like to be until we are
    willing to ask ourselves just why the lives we lead on this continent
    are mainly so empty, so tame, and so ugly.  </dt>
  <dd><em>James Baldwin</em>

    from 1833--1853
  </dd>

  <dt>Man, unless he has experienced the influence of learning and
    philosophy, is subject to impulses worse than those of a wild
    beast. There is no beast more savage and dangerous than a human being
    who is swept along by the passions of ambition, greed, anger, envy,
    extravagance, and sensuality.  </dt>
  <dd>Erasmus

  <dt>The thing that makes you exceptional, if you are at all, is inevitably
    that which must also make you lonely.  </dt>
  <dd>Lorraine Hansberry
  </dd>

  <dt>You seldom get what you pay for, but you never get what you don't pay
    for. </dt>

# Religion & Philosophy

<dl class="quote">
  <dt>Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others,

  <dt>The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist where
    private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. Only
    where the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time
    absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time
    for the rights of the poor, can the beauties of Paris be realized. 
  </dt>
