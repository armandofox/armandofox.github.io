crappy proprietary app for accessing school
data](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/11/these-parents-built-a-school-app-then-the-city-called-the-cops/)

* Swedish govt spends years & years & $$$$$  having 5 companies build national platform for schools (combination of LMS, registration info, grades, parent portal, student portal...)

* The apps suck, are buggy, and get awful reviews on app stores and lots of parental complaints (since they're the only way parents can get info about how their kids are doing in school, etc)

* some techie parents reverse engineer the apps' server APIs and create their own open-source mobile apps, which are widely praised, as well as a well-designed publicly-accessible API shim over the original crappy undocumented API

* city & vendors crack down, launch national investigation around "possble illegal access to data" and other nonsense; starts tweaking APIs to deliberately break the open source app...this makes about as much sense as the gov of  missouri going after the guy who pointed out the website bug that was exposing teachers' SS#s as hidden fields in HTML (i'm sure you read about this, but it's another good "SaaS in the news" if not)

* nation eventually comes to its senses and now there is an "official"
decent API that anyone (with permission and API key) will be able to
use to build similar apps
