This page contains various possibly-useful information for current and prospective students.

**Prospective students: **I cannot help you get admitted to Berkeley, but if you are admitted I'd be happy to talk to you about working together.

**Thinking of graduate school?  The best things you can do are to [come to
undergrad advising]({% link _pages/students/advising.md %}), where one of the
things we talk about is [getting involved in undergraduate
research]({% link _pages/students/research.md %}) and why that's important
if you're considering grad school.  There's also a great collection of
comments from [MIT faculty on what they're looking for in
applications.](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/what-faculty-members-are-looking-for-in-a-grad-school-application-essay/)

**Traveling to a conference or professional event?** Use this template I made ([PPT template](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxhcm1hbmRvZm94fGd4OjcxYjlkYjdiOWNlZjI1Y2M) for making a card to submit to a print shop; [Word template](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxhcm1hbmRvZm94fGd4OjM5MTkxYjllYmY1OWJjMjA) for printing directly on Avery #5871 die-cut business card stock).
-   Do you have a (nice, clean, simple, not full of BS Javascript animations, professional-looking) home page? Is there a link to your résumé or CV clearly visible on that page?
