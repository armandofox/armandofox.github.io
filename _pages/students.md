This page contains various possibly-useful information for current and prospective students.

**Prospective students: **I cannot help you get admitted to Berkeley, but if you are admitted I'd be happy to talk to you about working together.

**Berkeley undergrads:** Thinking of graduate school?  The best things you can do are to [come to
undergrad advising]({% link _pages/students/advising.md %}), where one of the
things we talk about is [getting involved in undergraduate
research]({% link _pages/students/research.md %}) and why that's important
if you're considering grad school.  There's also a great collection of
comments from [MIT faculty on what they're looking for in
applications.](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/what-faculty-members-are-looking-for-in-a-grad-school-application-essay/)

**Traveling to a conference or professional event?**

* You should be
prepared to hand out business cards.  Yes, people still use them.
Use this template I made
([PPT template](/assets/office/bizcard.pptx) for making a card to
submit to a print shop; 
[Word template](/assets/office/bizcards-10up-Avery5871.docx)
for printing directly on Avery #5871 die-cut business card stock).

* Do you have a (nice, clean, simple, not full of BS Javascript
animations, professional-looking) home page? Is there a link to your
résumé or CV clearly visible on that page?  

* Is your GitHub
username on your CV?  (Your code is like an artist's portfolio--it says a lot
about you that can't be deduced from your resume.)
