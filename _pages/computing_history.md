- My occasional [blog posts on computing
history](/category/Tech+history)
- [Armando's Computer History
Minute](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PJXlREtCELxTGiLt0MCYDF-JS1jxLTxz?usp=sharing):
a set of occasional 5-minute detours in computing history, which I
incorporate into my lectures
- [In Praise of
BASIC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxdSXkepKBOIQTFpNmdxblE2bWs),
a piece I wrote on the cultural impact of one of the world's most
maligned programming languages, yet one of the most influential. This
is the first in a series I will call the Dead Standards Society,
paying homage to standards and quasi-standards that are now
defunct/obsolete but without which important milestones in the
computing revolution would not have happened.
- I periodically host groups of [Berkeley CS
Scholars](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs-scholars) on a trip to the
awesome [Computer History Museum](http://computerhistory.org/). This
is
the [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FLPAiPpDy_3WDUuM67yDdnpNgHT2vBgsaXJsiUIw3Ok/edit?usp=sharing) I
created to accompany the visit. I'm hoping to eventually create a full
online "course" on this topic that also serves as a self-guidable CHM
tour.

# Computing History Films

- [Mastergeek
Theater](/mastergeek-theater),
an infrequently-updated list of the best full-length and short-feature
movies/documentaries about computing history
- My [YouTube computing history
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9BFAAE9BFE0E2319) includes
some of the Mastergeek Theater content, plus many great short films
about computer history
