# Please be aware before contacting me…

* I don't do expert witness work, ever, but if you're specifically interested in my mobile computing work as a PhD student because you're trying to take down a patent troll, I've [put all that stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/armandofox/glomop) and good luck to you.

* Students who need a recommendation letter: please read these
[guidelines](/students/letters)
before requesting one. It’s for your own benefit.

* I don’t respond to recruiter inquiries of any kind. Sorry.

**Applying to Berkeley?** If you are a _current_ Berkeley undegraduate student applying to grad school etc., I would be happy to talk to you. Otherwise, I generally cannot respond to “cold call” emails regarding admission to Berkeley. If you're admitted I'll be happy to talk to you once you're here.

**Seeking a summer research internship or postdoc?** Select For Students > Undergraduate Research above.
