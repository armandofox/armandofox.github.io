CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7iWezg_-jJVq6oLEvehPye41V8ivlw1-fv0tMg0nr3dIh1Twkbhcxbzxqkh8huYg72T_EnJFnzZ4E/pub)

# Apologies, but I will not respond to the following inquiries...

* Remote internships from students outside the Bay Area.

* Postdoc/technical staff inquiries.  If I have a need/opportunity,
I will make sure to publicize it through the channels the University requires.

* Expert witness work.  If you're specifically interested in my mobile
computing work as a PhD student because you're trying to take down a
patent troll, I've [put all that stuff on
GitHub](https://github.com/armandofox/glomop) and good luck to you.  I
don't do any expert witness or expert consulting for IP cases, period.

* Recruiter inquiries of any kind.  I'm not
interested in leaving Berkeley, consulting, working in industry, or
helping you headhunt.  Sorry.

* Requests to evaluate a product in my classroom.

# Students...

**Requesting a recommendation/reference letter?**  Glad to hear you
are moving to a new career phase!!  Please read these
[guidelines](/students/letters)
first, so we know how best to proceed.

**Applying to Berkeley?** If you are a _current_ Berkeley undergraduate student applying to grad school etc., I would be happy to talk to you. Otherwise, I generally cannot respond to "cold call" emails regarding admission to Berkeley. If you're admitted I'll be happy to talk to you once you're here.

**Seeking a summer research internship?** Select For Students >
Undergraduate Research above.  I can only work with Bay Area students
(or those who will physically be in the Bay Area during summer).
