# I will not respond to the following kinds of inquiries

* Remote internships from students outside the Bay Area.

* Postdoc/technical staff inquiries.  If I have a need/opportunity,
you'll know.

* Expert witness work.  If you're specifically interested in my mobile computing work as a PhD student because you're trying to take down a patent troll, I've [put all that stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/armandofox/glomop) and good luck to you.

* Recruiter inquiries of any kind.  I'm not
interested in leaving Berkeley, consulting, working in industry, or
anything like that.  Sorry.

* Requests to evaluate a product in my classroom.

# Students...

**Requesting a recommendation/reference letter?**  Please read these
[guidelines](/students/letters)
first, for your own benefit.

**Applying to Berkeley?** If you are a _current_ Berkeley undergraduate student applying to grad school etc., I would be happy to talk to you. Otherwise, I generally cannot respond to “cold call” emails regarding admission to Berkeley. If you're admitted I'll be happy to talk to you once you're here.
