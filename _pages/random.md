## Bibliomania

I am a bibliophile.  That is, not only do I love reading, I love books
and all things associated with them.  I can and do spend hours in used
bookstores and libraries; finding good ones is often a major goal when I
visit a new city or country.

- You can read my [occasional book reviews on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVJOUDG4KIYJVQIOKHODUDCCB4Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8)

- Or the [extended book summaries on this
blog](/category/Book+summary)

- And of course like all pretentious people I harvest
[quotes](/quotes.md) from my reading

## Hobby projects

[My coding projects](https://github.com/armandofox) ranging from
partially useful (E-Z BART) to super useless. Knock yourself out.  A
few of interest:

-   ~~[PogoVision](https://github.com/armandofox/PogoVision-server), a photo-scrolling screensaver/app for Roku meant to imitate AppleTV's screensaver mode~~.  Discontinued because the free Roku app *PhotoView for Google Photos* does this as well as acting as a pretty decent album viewer.
-   [Alexa BART app](https://github.com/armandofox/alexa-bart-py). "Alexa, ask BART when is the next train to downtown Berkeley." ... "Alexa, ask BART what train will get me to 16th and Mission by 7 pm."
-   [Latex2ebook](https://github.com/armandofox/latex2ebook), a toolchain for the Unix-savvy to produce both beautiful PDF and functional AZW (Amazon Kindle format) from the same LaTeX sources.
-   [E-Z BART](https://github.com/armandofox/ezbart), which I made
when [BART](https://bart.gov) revamped their mobile website and made it much more awkward
to use
