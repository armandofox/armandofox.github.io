-   **Undergraduates interested in CS375**: CS375 as a graduate course requires permission codes for undergraduate students to be able to enroll.  Undergraduates hired as (U)GSIs for CS/EECS classes should contact [Cindy Conners](mailto:csconners@cs.berkeley.edu) to enroll. *After *all CS/EECS (U)GSIs can be accommodated in CS375/EE375, other undergrads can sign up closer to the beginning of the semester.  Please consider signing up for CS370 instead, as it is better set up to handle larger enrollments.

**Always available online at edX: **[Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails](http://saas-class.org/)
