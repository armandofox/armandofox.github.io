# Thinking of graduate school?

The first question to ask yourself is _why grad school_, which is
related to the second question, _which kind of grad school_.

As far as CS grad programs, there are basically three kinds:

* "Research-oriented" masters, including the Berkeley CS 5th year MS, where a key part of the program is to
produce some publishable original research. In practice, I set the bar
at "something we'd feel comfortable submitting to a high quality
conference or workshop" (even if it is not accepted).  Others'
policies may vary.  The 5th year MSCS at Berkeley is an example.
Berkeley CS takes very very few "external" terminal MS students.
This program is a great opportunity for EECS undergrads, but you will
be expected to work on some research and you need a faculty champion
who will agree at application time to be your advisor if you're
admitted. I and many other faculty will only do this if we have
already worked with you for at least a semester prior to your
application process. 
In practice, 3.5 GPA is approximate cutoff for 5yr MS; 3.75 is not uncommon.

* "Professional" masters, focused on advanced coursework, possibly a
capstone project, and often a shared emphasis with
leadership/entrepreneurship skills.  The Berkeley M.Eng. program
(7%-20% admit rate, comparable in competitiveness to PhD admissions!) is a
good example: you take 6 units of leadership-related courses from the Fung Institute, 6 units of graduate-level EECS courses, and a 5-unit capstone/integration project.
Stanford has a terminal MS as well, though I'm not sure
if it emphasizes professional leadership as much as the M.Eng. does.
Georgia Tech has an excellent and very affordable online MSCS, which
leads to the same degree as their on-campus MSCS; it includes advanced
courses with projects, but again, I'm not sure how much emphasis on
professional leadership.

* PhD programs, where you commit to spending the next 4-5 years of
your life producing a significant piece of research (typically several
papers' worth) that advances the field in some fundamental way.  This is an intense
5-year monastic experience that is nothing like undergrad. It's more a
calling than a thing you do. You really want to be sure that this
interests you, as opposed to doing it "by default".

I would be cautious about applying to PhD programs if you have no
experience doing research: some people love it, some hate it, and if
you hate it, it's going to be a long 5 years since that is all you
will do.  The sooner you [get involved in undergrad research]({ link
_pages/students/research.md }) the sooner you'll know if this option
is for you.

Whichever you do, apply broadly, as grad school admissions are very
competitive; "hot" fields like AI and data science may
be harder to get into. Don't limit yourself to the "usual subjects"
list of top schools: talk to professors and grad students working in
your areas of interest to find out which programs are strong in that
area---you'll be surprised. 


# You can always come back

You can leave school, go to industry for a while, and come back later.
That's what I did.  That way you really know if it's what you want to
do.  You can leave with a BS or MS and if you get good letters from an
employer, you certainly won't be in a _weaker_ position to apply!

# If you really love teaching

If you're considering a teaching focused career, *most* college level teaching
positions require (or strongly advise) a Masters but not usually a
PhD; the exception is a few schools where Teaching Professors are
expected to have PhD's, Berkeley being one of the few notable
examples.  Teaching at the pre-college level benefits from a Masters
but does not always require one, but may require other teaching
practice credentials.

**The 5th year MS is a great pathway to try out research (stepping
stone to PhD applications), for industry, or to pursue a teaching position.**

# What matters for PhD applications?

The following is only lightly edited from the rubric used in Berkeley CS PhD
admissions meetings each year:

"Look for strong PhD potential evidenced by, among other things:
* glowing letter 
* existing research record relative to opportunities available to them
* GPA / academic performance / chose tough courses
* **well articulated research interests**
* achieving a lot relative to context/opportunity
* communication skills (essay, interview)
* will be able to TA
* contributor to community (lab, dept, broader community)"


# What matters for grad school applications?

* GPA is important but mostly to be above a "soft" threshold that's
probably in the 3.7 range.

* Letters of reference are really important.  Academic writers are
preferred; many professors will get help from their PhD students
who've worked directly with you when writing letters.  Industry
letters are OK, but make sure the writer knows how to write an
academic recommendation letter -- it's not at all the same as a job
reference!  If they're not sure, ask your research
advisor/mentor/champion if they're willing to have a talk with the
letter writer to guide them.

* Your research statement is important - not because anyone holds you
to doing what you describe, but to determine that you understand the
research landscape in your area and know how to write concretely about
a plausible project.  

* Your personal statement is important because it contextualizes your
achievements and (importantly) can give a sense of what else you can
bring to your cohort of fellow students besides academic ability.

#  Using LLMs to write your statements

Don't do it.  Almost every strong PhD program at some point includes a
personal interview with one or more faculty and/or current grad
students, and it is obvious within 30 seconds if the person on Zoom is
the same person that wrote the statements.  It's fine to have LLMs
correct actual errors of style, grammar, and orthography, but the
ability to communicate clearly, in your own voice, orally and in
writing, is a key skill not only for PhD admissions but for your
professional career.  Any time spent honing communication skills is
time well invested.
