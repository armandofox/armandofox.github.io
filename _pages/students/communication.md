As a professional, you are part of a network.

The way you communicate (or fail to) within that network has a
first-order effect on how you're perceived and treated by your
colleagues, on the reputation you develop, and therefore on your long
term career prospects.

I've noticed a disturbing lack of awareness of professional
communication habits on the part of many students I've worked with
recently, so I thought I'd at least clarify my own expectations when
communicating with my colleagues--which includes students.

**Agree on a communication mechanism and be disciplined about using
it.**  If you're working as part of a group or with an advisor or
colleague, decide what mechanisms you'll use to keep in touch---email,
Slack, whatever---and about how often you plan to check.  If I know
you're not checking before 8pm, I'll know not to ask you for anything
that requires a reply before that time.

**Set expectations for reply time, and honor them.** I will expect that if
we've set a "reply within 2 days" policy that I can expect to hear
back within 2 days of contacting you by our preferred method.

**Don't ghost your network.**  Great, so you graduated, got that paper
submitted, or whatever.  You still have a relationship with the others
who worked with you.  You still have an obligation to maintain your
communication as part of taht relationship.  If you need to withdraw
from that network, give a clear heads-up and offer the chance for
anyone else to get what they need from you before you disappear:
"I'll be starting a new job shortly and unable to stay involved with
this group.  Are there any assets [code, data, documentation, etc] you
all need that are currently controlled by me?  Is there anything
anyone needs from me specifically in order to continue their work?"

**If you do ghost your network after finishing a milestone, you'll get
a reputation as transactional:** someone who tosses aside a
professional relationship after they've gotten what _they_ need out of
it.  That makes it hard to recruit collaborators or get support in the
future.
