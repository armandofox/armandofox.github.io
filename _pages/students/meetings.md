## Agenda

keep running agenda in one place (on one page)

distribute in advance if it implies any preparation, or cancel

**Don't** distribute the agenda via email.  Most people at Berkeley
get hundreds of emails a day and it'll get lost.  Keep the agenda
online (web page, Google doc), include the link in the meeting's
calendar event, and optionally include the link in a meeting reminder
email. 

## Start at the published time

## Minutes/notes

Summarize, don't transcribe

    An outline should be hierarchical.
