Poster sessions are great.  You can build your network, 

# Dave Patterson's Seven Commandments for making a bad poster:

(Here are a [few slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d9rAG1mD4C0hTgNZNyAAI4vM2DimeW4n/edit#slide=id.p40) humorously illustrating a subset of the
Commandments.) 

**I.  THOU SHALT NOT ILLUSTRATE.** Confucius says ``A picture = 10K
words,'' but Dijkstra says ``Pictures are for weak minds.''  Who are
you going to believe?

* Counter-commandment: Pictures tell a story.  Screen shots,
architecture diagrams, graphs showing results, are all far more
valuable than text.  The poster is there to provide visual aids for
your spiel (see item VI), not to be a stand-alone resource.

**II.  THOU SHALT NOT COVET BREVITY.**  Do you want to continue the
stereotype that engineers can't write?  Always use complete sentences,
never just key words. If possible, use whole paragraphs and read every
word.

* Counter-commandment: Again, the poster is there to support your
explanation.  Someone who's trying to read full sentences on your
poster is not listening to you.  Less text is better, but if you need
text, single-line-long bullets with key words only (not complete
sentences) are preferred.

**III.    THOU SHALT NOT PRINT LARGE.** Your work was hard to do, so it
should take lots of text to explain. If they're really interestd,
they'll come up real close and read every word.

* Counter-commandment: It's awkward to press your nose up against a
poster to read 11-point text.  If the text is important enough to
read, it should be readable from a couple of feet away, allowing for a
non-awkward social experience when multiple people are around the poster.

**IV.   THOU SHALT NOT USE COLOR.** Flagrant use of color indicates
uncareful research.  It's also  unfair to emphasize some words over
others.

* Counter-commandment: Don't use color gratuitously, but do use color
to highlight important text, to frame important graphics, and to
actively call attention to the most important elements.


**V. THOU SHALT NOT CALL ATTENTION TO THYSELF.** Be humble. Your work's
inner beauty will speak for itself and people will come just to see
what it's all about.

* Counter-commandment: Poster sessions can be busy and chaotic.  A
poster with clear visual appeal will draw people over.


**VI.   THOU SHALT NOT PREPARE A SHORT ORAL OVERVIEW.**  Let the viewer do
the work, and ask you questions (if any questions remain after they
read your brilliant words).

* Counter-commandment:  Prepare a 1-2 minute (max) "spiel" that
highlights your motivation/problem, your one big idea, and a highlight
of the results so far or status of the project.  This will help you
figure out if the poster really has all the necessary elements to
support the story you are trying to tell.


**VII. THOU SHALT NOT PRACTICE.** Why waste research time practicing a
spiel? It could take several hours out of your months of work on the
project.  How can you appear spontaneous if you practice?  Besides, if
you are a teacher or TA, you have lots of experience talking for hours when
you donâ€™t know what  to say.

* Counter-commandment: You want to converse with your audience, not
lecture at them.  To do that, time your spiel, practice it
until you have it down, and make sure everyone at the poster has a
consistent version of it.  Don't read off a script; have a small
number of talking points and get good at "telling a story" by fleshing
out each of the points.

# At the poster session

* Have business cards to give out, if it's an "external" poster
session (conference, workshop, etc., vs. in-class posters).  It's a
good way to build your network and stay in touch with people
interested in your work.  After the session, send a quick followup
email to each person you exchanged cards with, thanking them for their
interest and offering to stay in contact if appropriate.

* Every project member at the poster should know the spiel and have
practiced it.  You can work in shifts or rotate who is at the poster
(so that, e.g., other project members can walk around and see other posters).

* When people ask questions, everyone who wants to contribute to the
discussion should be able to do so.  Even if you're on a roll
answering someone's questions, visually check in with your peers
periodically to see if anyone wants to add to the discussion.
