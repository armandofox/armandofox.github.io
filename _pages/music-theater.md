I'm a pianist/conductor, music director, accompanist, and generally
can do whatever is needed musically.  My main instrument is
piano/keyboards (40+ years of mileage, including classical training,
jazz improv, etc.) but I play others too.

# Ways I support local theater

- I see lots of shows. [Here's a list]({% link
_pages/music-theater/theaters.md %}) of theaters in the Bay Area I
frequent and/or subscribe to.  Join my email list (at right) if you
want to come with me!

-   I hope the advice in my book [Piano/Conductor: So They Talked You
Into Being Music Director](http://pianoconductor.com/)  will be useful
to  both new and experienced Music Directors. The link is to purchase
hardcopy on Amazon, but you can [download the
PDF](/assets/pdf/pianoconductor.pdf) for free.
If you're a musical theater actor but not a pianist/MD, you may
find helpful this
[subset of chapters](/assets/pdf/pianoconductor-actor-chapters.pdf)
focusing on how the MD works with performers on both the technical and
dramatic aspects of performing theater music.

open-source ticketing/subscription/donation management/CRM for small
theaters.

various theaters is summarized in my open-source [Small Theater Growth & Development Field Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh1Z-3zFnCa_uQEoKzkjhGA_kShPf2wY8ZG7FuVJG9g/edit?usp=sharing).

# I Play Some Instruments

I play piano and keyboards very well, drums reasonably well, single
reeds (clarinet and tenor/alto sax) not very well at all, and I'm
slowly getting better on accordion, harmonica, and tin whistle.

As a really young kid, I tried to self-teach playing by ear on those cheap
air-powered 70s home organs.  We started with one of 
[these Magnus
mini-organs](https://reverb.com/item/67949163-magnus-model-7000-chord-organ)
(2 octaves, 6 major chords),
then upgraded to a
[GTR organ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=LlApSIJ8dQ8) (3 octaves, 7
sets of major/minor/dominant-7th chords), and finally
a [Baldwin 2-manual "Interlude with FunMachine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTcMAyOjTY).

I started **classical piano** training at age 5 with private instructors 
and later completed the Mannes College of Music (now part of the [New
School](http://newschool.edu/)) Certificate Program including piano
performance with concert pianist and educator [Michael
Boriskin](https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+boriskin) and
others, ensemble, theory, ear training, orchestration, choir, chamber
performance, ...the whole enchilada. 

My [**graduation recital
tracks**](https://soundcloud.com/armando-fox/sets/westrax) are
representative of that era, when my technical chops were slightly
more in shape than now but my musicality was less developed.  My jazz
improvisation is decent; I still aspire to solo effectively over the
Coltrane changes. I am a strong sightreader and I love to accompany soloists and participate in chamber music parties for fun.

I've been **keyboardist and drummer** (sometimes simultaneously) for
original & cover bands Spoon, Reminiscent Jam, and More At Eleven, all MIT Battle of the Bands
Finalists in 1990, 1987, and 1988 respectively.

My **vintage 80s synthesizers** (Roland Juno-106, Roland D-50, Yamaha
DX7) used in those bands have a new lease on life in my 80s cover
band [Disposable Pop](http://disposablepop.com/) (currently on 
hiatus).  Sure, I know those sounds are all available in software now,
but where's the charm in that?
