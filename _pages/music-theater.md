# Shows I'm Working On Now or Soon

**Coming in March 2023:** _Ruthless! The Musical_ at [Altarena Playhouse](altarena.org)

See below for shows I've worked on recently.

# Ways I support local theater

I go to the theater a lot.  [Here's a list]({% link
_pages/music-theater/theaters.md %}) of theaters I frequent
and/or subscribe to.

-   I hope the advice in my book [Piano/Conductor: So They Talked You Into Being Music Director](http://pianoconductor.com/)  will be useful to  both new and experienced Music Directors. The link is to purchase hardcopy on Amazon, but you can [download the PDF](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxhcm1hbmRvZm94fGd4OjIzNjRkNzI4MmJhYjY1YTQ) for free.

-   I maintain [Audience1st](https://www.audience1st.com/), the
open-source ticketing/subscription/donation management/CRM for small
theaters. The goal is not to make money off of small theaters but
rather support them in the critical mission of building a
subscriber/audience base, including subscription sales, ticket sales,
donations, etc., at the lowest possible price and with no per-ticket fees.

-   Board of Directors (2004-2012) and Advisory Board (2013-present) of [Altarena Playhouse](http://altarena.org/), the Bay Area's oldest continuously-operating community theater (founded 1938). 
-   Advisory Board, [Custom Made Theatre Co.,](http://custommade.org/) 2013-present.
-   Much of what I learned working with them and with others is summarized in my open-source [Small Theater Growth & Development Field Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh1Z-3zFnCa_uQEoKzkjhGA_kShPf2wY8ZG7FuVJG9g/edit?usp=sharing). 


# I Play Some Instruments

I play piano and keyboards very well, drums reasonably well, single
reeds (clarinet and tenor/alto sax) not very well at all, and I'm
slowly getting better on accordion, harmonica, and tin whistle.

I started **classical piano** training at age 5 with private instructors, and later completed the Mannes College of Music (now part of the [New School](http://newschool.edu/)) Certificate Program including piano performance with concert pianist and educator [Michael Boriskin](http://www.dworkincompany.com/html/boriskin/boriskin_artist.html) and others, ensemble, theory, ear training, orchestration, choir, chamber performance, ...the whole enchilada.

My [**graduation recital
tracks**](https://soundcloud.com/armando-fox/sets/westrax) are
representative of that era, when my technical chops were slightly
better than now but my musicality was less developed.  My jazz
improvisation is decent; I aspire to do better soloing over the
Coltrane changes. I am a strong sightreader and I love to accompany soloists and participate in chamber music parties for fun.

I've been **keyboardist and drummer** (sometimes simultaneously) for original & cover bands Spoon (MIT Battle of the Bands finalist 1990), More At Eleven (MIT Battle of the Bands finalist 1987), and Reminiscent Jam (MIT Battle of the Bands Finalist 1988).

My **vintage 80s synthesizers** (Juno-106, D50, DX7) used in those bands have a new lease on life in my 80s cover band [Disposable Pop](http://disposablepop.com/) (currently on COVID hiatus).
