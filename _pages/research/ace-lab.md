The [ACE Lab](https://acelab.berkeley.edu) (Algorithms and Computing
in Education) brings together faculty and students in computer
science, education, and information/learning sciences to explore the
many ways in which computing can support pedagogy.

There is some emphasis on STEM and CS in particular since we like to
deploy and evaluate our work in real classes, and Berkeley has some
quite large CS classes that make great testing environments, but we do
work in other areas of education as well.

My specific work within ACE tends to focus on support for teaching
upper-division software engineering techniques (think "CS100" rather
than "CS1").
