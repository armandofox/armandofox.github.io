# Diversity at Berkeley

I'm working to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion (especially in
Computer Science) at all levels, both through service appointments and
in my teaching and research.

## Diversity-related teaching and research

* With Dan Garcia and others, the [LEARNER
Center](https://learner.berkeley.edu) is promoting mastery learning in
EECS and CoE courses by creating and evaluating the effectiveness of
automated question generators for 
student practice.  Mastery learning has been shown effective in narrowing equity gaps.

* With Masters student Fuzail Shakir, 
creating and evaluating tools and policies for streamlining the
process of using
[Flextensions (flexible
extensions)](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/),
a set of practices around flexible extension policies that we believe
will enhance student learning with minimal staff time cost.

* I regularly teach our CS Pedagogy course (which all first-time CS
TAs must take) and we recently presented a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569826) on how we've been
using DEIBJ as a lens through which to teach CS pedagogy.

## Diversity-related Service

-   Department level: I'm a CS Graduate Diversity Officer, member of EECS Anti-Racism Working Group, faculty sponsor of [CS Scholars](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs-scholars) program

-   **NEW:** Check out the one-stop *[Broadening Participation in EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/bpe) *resources page!

-   College of Engineering level: member of CoE E&I Council
-   UC Berkeley campus level:  [Equity Advisor](https://campusclimate.berkeley.edu/faculty/our-programs-and-services/faculty-equity-advisors)
-   CS academia level: UC Berkeley representative to [CMD-IT LEAP Alliance](http://leapalliance.org/) to dramatically improve diversity in the CS professoriate


## "I'm a student wishing to be more directly involved in diversity-enhancing activities..."

That's great! This campaign will be waged one battle at a time and we eagerly want your help---just make sure you balance it with your student obligations. (The best thing you can do for diversity is secure your academic standing and eventual career, so you will be in the strongest position to help others.)

Here are some suggestions of what you can do on campus right now (thanks to [Audrey Sillers, Director of Student Diversity for EECS](mailto:araya@berkeley.edu), with whom I work very closely):

-   Get involved with [BiasBusters](biasbusters.berkeley.edu)! They're always looking to recruit younger members for continuity. BiasBusters was conceived by our students attending the [Tapia Conference](http://tapiaconference.org/) and learning about the organization and then emulating here it at Berkeley.
-   Reach out to student groups such as LAGSES or BGESS (graduate), or HES or BESSA (undergraduate)---they often do direct outreach and mentoring to pre-college as well as college students.
-   Get involved in CS Scholars.
-   BAIR is starting a mentoring program (inspired by CS Scholars) for PhD students and URM undergrads.  Graduate student [Rudy Corona Rodriguez](mailto:rcorona@berkeley.edu) has more info.
-   Mentoring a [SUPERB](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb) student directly impacts the likelihood of that student later being admitted to a PhD program. 
-   If you attend Tapia, SHPE, SACNAS, NSBE, Grace Hopper, ... sign up to work at the Berkeley booth and directly advise prospective applicants! [Audrey Sillers](mailto:araya@berkeley.edu) can help with this.


# Diversity in the US: Get Out the Vote!

If you want to support nonprofit, nonpartisan, nonlobbying organizations focused on
getting out the vote:

**501(c)(3) organizations focused on "getting out the vote" generally **(donations are tax deductible)**:**

-   [HeadCount](http://headcount.org/) facilitates social/political activism by registering voters, voter education, and get-out-the-vote activities
-   [The Brennan Center for Justice](http://brennancenter.org/) is a nonpartisan think tank focused on legal and policy issues around social justice, and is currently quite active in combating the "vote by mail is fraudulent" campaign being waged by the incumbent candidate.
-   [VoteAmerica](http://voteamerica.com/) is a
largely-philanthropy-supported effort to help US voters navigate the
processes of registering and voting in their state, whether in person
or by mail.

**501(c)(3) organizations focusing specifically on communities of color **(donations are tax deductible):

-   [AccelerateChange.org](http://acceleratechange.org/) supports several nonprofit digital media ventures including [ProjectPulso](http://projectpulso.org/), which reaches out via cellphones specifically to mobilize and deliver news relevant to Latinx voters.
-   [Voto Latino Foundation](https://votolatino.org/about/vl-foundation/) is dedicated to registering Latinx voters and encouraging their civic participation. *See below for VotoLatino.org.*
-   [PoderLatinX foundation](http://poderlatinx.org/501c3) focuses on educating Latinx voters in key states. *See below for PoderLatinX.org voter registration.*

**501(c)(4) or other organizations **(donations are *not* tax deductible), **some of which have an affiliated 501(c)(3) in the list above:**

-   [PoderLatinX.org](http://poderlatinx.org/) focuses on Latinx voter reg in key states. (Affiliated 501(c)(3): [PoderLatinX foundation](http://poderlatinx.org/501c3) above)
-   [VotoLatino.org](http://votolatino.org/) has a similar mission but is national.  (Affiliated 501(c)(3): [Voto Latino Foundation](https://votolatino.org/about/vl-foundation/) above)
-   [VoteForward](http://votefwd.org/) enlists volunteers to send 1-on-1 "get out the vote" letters to individual voters in key states with strategic timing to encourage them to vote.
-   [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/about-fair-fight/) was started by Stacey Abrams to support "voter protection" programs to combat voter suppression in Georgia and elsewhere.
