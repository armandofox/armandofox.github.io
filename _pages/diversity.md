# Diversity at Berkeley

I'm working to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion (especially in Computer Science) at all levels:

-   Department level: CS Graduate Diversity Officer, member of EECS Anti-Racism Working Group, faculty sponsor of [CS Scholars](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs-scholars) program

-   **NEW:** Check out the one-stop *[Broadening Participation in EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/bpe) *resources page!

-   College of Engineering level: CoE E&I Council
-   UC Berkeley campus level:  [Equity Advisor](https://campusclimate.berkeley.edu/faculty/our-programs-and-services/faculty-equity-advisors)
-   CS academia level: UC Berkeley representative to [CMD-IT LEAP Alliance](http://leapalliance.org/) to dramatically improve diversity in the CS professoriate


## "I'm a student wishing to be more directly involved in diversity-enhancing activities..."

That's great! This campaign will be waged one battle at a time and we eagerly want your help---just make sure you balance it with your student obligations. (The best thing you can do for diversity is secure your academic standing and eventual career, so you will be in the strongest position to help others.)

Here are some suggestions of what you can do on campus right now (thanks to [Audrey Sillers, Director of Student Diversity for EECS](mailto:araya@berkeley.edu), with whom I work very closely):

-   Get involved with [BiasBusters](biasbusters.berkeley.edu)! They're always looking to recruit younger members for continuity. BiasBusters was conceived by our students attending the [Tapia Conference](http://tapiaconference.org/) and learning about the organization and then emulating here it at Berkeley.
-   Reach out to student groups such as LAGSES or BGESS (graduate), or HES or BESSA (undergraduate)---they often do direct outreach and mentoring to pre-college as well as college students.
-   Get involved in CS Scholars.
-   BAIR is starting a mentoring program (inspired by CS Scholars) for PhD students and URM undergrads.  Graduate student [Rudy Corona Rodriguez](mailto:rcorona@berkeley.edu) has more info.
-   Mentoring a [SUPERB](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb) student directly impacts the likelihood of that student later being admitted to a PhD program. 
-   If you attend Tapia, SHPE, SACNAS, NSBE, Grace Hopper, ... sign up to work at the Berkeley booth and directly advise prospective applicants! [Audrey Sillers](mailto:araya@berkeley.edu) can help with this.


# Diversity in the US: Get Out the Vote!

It's critical that the voices of
voters of color be heard, especially Latinx and Black voters. I
recently reached out to colleagues to identify organizations that are
helping to mobilize Latinx and Black voters, in case you want to
support them with a cash donation or volunteering your time. Here are
the highlights of the results. Note that while I have vetted these
through my own Googling and
on [CharityNavigator](http://charitynavigator.org/) where appropriate,
this page is informational and not an endorsement. 

**501(c)(3) organizations focused on "getting out the vote" generally **(donations are tax deductible)**:**

-   [HeadCount](http://headcount.org/) facilitates social/political activism by registering voters, voter education, and get-out-the-vote activities
-   [The Brennan Center for Justice](http://brennancenter.org/) is a nonpartisan think tank focused on legal and policy issues around social justice, and is currently quite active in combating the "vote by mail is fraudulent" campaign being waged by the incumbent candidate.
-   [VoteAmerica](http://voteamerica.com/) is a largely-philanthropy-supported effort to help US voters navigate the processes of registering and voting in their state, whether in person or by mail.
-   conducts rigorous research to identify problems and provide in-depth empirical findings and compelling analyses of pressing legal and policy issues. We also pioneer and champion policy solutions, such as automatic voter registration and small donor public financing

**501(c)(3) organizations focusing specifically on communities of color **(donations are tax deductible):

-   [AccelerateChange.org](http://acceleratechange.org/) supports several nonprofit digital media ventures including [ProjectPulso](http://projectpulso.org/), which reaches out via cellphones specifically to mobilize and deliver news relevant to Latinx voters.
-   [Voto Latino Foundation](https://votolatino.org/about/vl-foundation/) is dedicated to registering Latinx voters and encouraging their civic participation. *See below for VotoLatino.org.*
-   [PoderLatinX foundation](http://poderlatinx.org/501c3) focuses on educating Latinx voters in key states. *See below for PoderLatinX.org voter registration.*

**501(c)(4) or other organizations **(donations are *not* tax deductible), **some of which have an affiliated 501(c)(3) in the list above:**

-   [CommitToFlipBlue.com](http://committoflipblue.com/) includes phone-bank volunteers working every day of the week (they're looking for volunteers) to reach Latinx voters in particular in swing/flip states.
-   [PoderLatinX.org](http://poderlatinx.org/) focuses on Latinx voter reg in key states. (Affiliated 501(c)(3): [PoderLatinX foundation](http://poderlatinx.org/501c3) above)
-   [VotoLatino.org](http://votolatino.org/) has a similar mission but is national.  (Affiliated 501(c)(3): [Voto Latino Foundation](https://votolatino.org/about/vl-foundation/) above)
-   [VoteForward](http://votefwd.org/) enlists volunteers to send 1-on-1 "get out the vote" letters to individual voters in key states with strategic timing to encourage them to vote.
-   [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/about-fair-fight/) was started by Stacey Abrams to support "voter protection" programs to combat voter suppression in Georgia and elsewhere.
