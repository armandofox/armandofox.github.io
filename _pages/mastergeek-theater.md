Various movies, some documentary and some fictional, chronicle the history and social impact of our field. I thought it would be fun to watch some of these as a group and then talk about them. All are pre-screened by me, so you know they're good. 

This list is also available as a [public list on IMDb](https://m.imdb.com/list/ls560519623).

# 1941-1945: Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes

# 1941-1945: Codebreakers---The Secret Genius of World War Two
{: .section}

![](/assets/img/mastergeek-theater/codebreakers.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}

You may think you know the story already: Bletchley Park is where Alan Turing developed techniques that were used to crack the Nazi's Enigma cipher machine (on which DES was based, incidentally). But the effort that really won the war is a story largely untold with heroes mostly unsung, because they were required to hold it in secrecy throughout the rest of their lives after the war ended. This documentary tells the story of how the brilliant rookie mathematician William Tutte came up with a technique to crack the much more sophisticated "Tunny" cipher, and how engineer Tommy Flowers designed and built the world's first semi-programmable digital computer to automate the technique, shortening the war by months or years and playing a key role in turning the tide in favor of the Allies.

This video is currently available on the CuriosityStream boutique channel; not sure where else.

Looking back on a little-known part of the war effort that recruited female mathematicians to work as "computers" for the U.S. Army during World War II, this eye-opening documentary sheds light on some remarkable unsung American heroines. From developing ballistics tables to programming the first electronic computer designed to improve Army efficiency, these top-secret "Rosies" made critical wartime contributions.

# 1955-1975: The Real Revolutionaries
{: .section}

![](/assets/img/mastergeek-theater/real-revolutionaries.png){: .align-left .thumb}

The quintessential---and original---Silicon Valley story of the "traitorous eight" engineers who left Shockley Semiconductor, the first Silicon Valley tech company, to found Fairchild Semiconductor, where the integrated circuit was not only invented but turned into a commercial phenomenon.  In time, most of the Fairchild Eight left to form their own spin-offs (the "Fairchildren"), including Intel (Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore) and AMD (Jerry Sanders), inventing the distinctive Silicon Valley corporate culture in the process.

# 1961-1969:  Moon Machines---The Apollo Guidance Computer
{: .section}

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h8is0WKNL._SY445_.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}

During Project Apollo, the US managed to land astronauts on the moon
and return them safely to Earth, not just once but ***six ***times.  How did we do that with a guidance computer based on 1960's technology, whose most innovative hardware feature was the solid-state NOR gate?  How did people program a machine whose ROM consisted of long "ropes" of magnetic cores strung onto braids of thin filaments?  What kind of UI can you get when the input consists of a 19-key keypad (big enough for astronauts wearing spacesuits) and the output consists of five LED 7-segment displays and a handful of "idiot light" indicators? Most intriguingly, this was the project that made NASA realize that software wasn't an afterthought to be dealt with following the hardware design, but the "pacing item" on the critical path for a complex embedded system.  Dr. Margaret Hamilton, the Director of Software for Project Apollo, is credited with inventing the term "software engineering." In 2016 President Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US's highest civilian honor.

**As a bonus**, you can not only check out the [Virtual Apollo Guidance Computer](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/), an app that does hardware-level emulation of this computer, but also view the [actual source code on GitHub.](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11) (It's a little known fact that all the source code for every Apollo mission is in the public domain, having been developed by a civilian agency at taxpayer expense. NASA intern Chris Garry has begun uploading it to GitHub.) Virtual AGC can be used to run the same bits the astronauts ran on each Apollo mission.

# 1960-1980: [Digital\_Man/Digital\_World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015355/)
{: .section}

![](/assets/img/mastergeek-theater/digitalman.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), an engineering-driven startup
spun out of MIT in the late 1950s, made computers affordable for
purchase by "the masses" at a time when most computers were rented
from giants like IBM.  The company essentially invented the
minicomputer product category and carved out an entire new market
segment for itself; ironically, it would  be on the receiving end of
this same realignment when PCs arrived in the late 1970s.  This film
is a profile of both the company's founder, Ken Olsen, and its revolutionary
products. 

# 1975-1991: Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires (released 1995)

Travel back to the 80's with snarky Silicon Valley pundit and gossip columnist---er, podcaster---[Robert X. Cringely](http://cringely.com/ "http://cringely.com"), to learn about the roots of the PC revolution, the early days of the microprocessor, and how we ended up with a computer on every desktop.  One of the best accessible treatments of the story of the rise of the PC, though on a couple of occasions the narrative wanders into stereotypes of gender and personality that (thankfully) raise more eyebrows today than they did in 1995.

-   Part 1: Impressing Their Friends (the Altair 8800, the birth of Microsoft, the first PCs)
-   Part 2: Riding the Bear (the PC takes over, IBM vs. Microsoft)
-   Part 3: Great Artists Steal (the story of the Mac and Windows)

# 1973-1982: Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: The Fate of Atari (released 2017)
{: .section}

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710pLJsBLXL._AC_UY218_.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}


"A game should be easy to learn and hard to master"---some have
attributed this as Bushnell's Law, for Atari cofounder Nolan
Bushnell. This documentary focuses on Atari's breakthrough
contributions to both arcade and (more significantly) home video
gaming, from its hubristic beginning to its demise at the hands of
management who didn't understand technology or their market. It's hard
to watch this without thinking of Apple and the Sculley years. A bit
long (1:50) but worthwhile for Atari completists, including interview
footage with Al Alcorn (UCB EECS '71), Eugene Jarvis (UCB EECS '76), Manny Gerard, Ray Kassar,
Howard Warshaw, and other names well known to those familiar with the
Atari saga.

{: .section}

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/910DwgyXPmL._SY445_.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}

The turbulent and fascinating story of Commodore, whose ruthless chairman, Holocaust survivor Jack Tramiel, successfully pursued his obsession of making "computers for the masses, not the classes." The Commodore VIC-20, the first computer to sell a million units, was a price/performance breakthrough that put a well-constructed (if underpowered) color computer within the reach of "the masses". Its successor, the price-shattering Commodore 64, remains the best-selling personal computer of all time. But Tramiel's unconventional way of running a company---"business is war"---made him a complex and sometimes difficult man to work for.

*"Before the first-person shooter, there was the second-person thinker."* Text adventures, or Interactive Fiction (IF), is one of the oldest categories of interactive entertainment. (Never heard of it? Read [this 1-page intro](http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/starters/Beginner.txt).) This documentary looks at the rise and subsequent disappearance of a fascinating subgenre whose potential perhaps remains underappreciated. As a gaming scholar wrote in 2000: "Lured by the siren song of ever-improving graphics power, terrified by the risks involved with truly unique ideas in gaming, the [gaming] industry is collectively stumbling along a path well worn by Hollywood." Watch this documentary and learn about the road not taken.

***As a bonus***, you can also play the original (1975) text adventure, ADVENT, compiled from the [original FORTRAN source code](http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/e_downloads.html)). We may also play classic adventures from pioneer Infocom (including Zork) on vintage hardware, and discuss an open-source DSL & bytecode interpreter for writing platform-independent text adventures, developed in the days when "port the software" meant "rewrite the software."

-   [*The Inform Designer's Manual*](http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/index.html).  Inform is a high-level DSL for creating adventure games that compile to ZIL interpretable by the Z-machine, created post hoc by reverse engineering ZIL.  The manual is both a language reference and a "howto" for creating interactive fiction.  Maybe someone can create an adventure that takes place in and around the RAD Lab...

# 1980-1995: BBS: The Documentary
{: .section}

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41diz9+N3FL.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}


Imagine a virtual, free-to-use public forum on the Internet where
anyone can post or reply to messages using connected PCs.  Some of
these sites are free and operated by hobbyists; others are commercial,
and the site managers ranged from smart hobbyists to clueless
get-rich-quick schemers who figured if they put some lame pr0n
pictures on the site, people might pay a monthly fee for access.

I'm referring, of course, to the Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) of the
1980s. The PCs were, of course, TRS-80s and Apple IIs and IBM clones,
connected to the communication network using analog landline modems
running at 300, 1200, 2400, and ultimately 56K baud.  It's easy to
forget that as late as the 1990s, local phone service was metered,
long-distance was unaffordable for most people, and having hundreds of
simultaneously active users on a site meant maintaining racks of
hundreds of modems. All the mini-dramas of the Internet---n00bs, pr0n,
warez, flame wars, stupid handles, FLOSS vs. Micro$oft, trolls,
clueless inve$tor$, foreign sites circumventing local rules---happened
here first.

{: .section}

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41sZ9yGMuyL.jpg){: .align-left .thumb}

Until 1990, the Internet was for academics and researchers.  The invention of the World Wide Web (today, just the "Web") in 1990 was a major turning point, but what brought the Web to the masses was the first point-and-click, easy-to-install graphical Web browser, NCSA Mosaic, later commercialized as Netscape Navigator.  The story of how Netscape took the IT world by storm, and what happened when Microsoft awoke to the threat, is the subject of this fast-paced documentary that reveals as much about the personalities involved---Marc Andreessen, Jim Clark, Bill Gates---as it does about the technologies that formed the IT battleground of the late 90s. Plus you get to see a mug shot of Bill Gates taken when he was arrested for dangerous driving.

Microsoft Windows may have kicked the living daylights out of the Mac,
but the war is far from over. Through interviews with Linus Torvalds,
Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond and others, we learn about the origins
of the open-source movement, the Free Software Foundation, and how
Linux became the first serious server OS to challenge Microsoft
Windows NT.

While all those people were earnestly trying to use computers to
"improve productivity," some slackers thought computers might be fun
for just playing games. The first video games predate PCs by several
years, and could only be played on equipment costing tens of thousands
of dollars. But video games took off with the invention of the microprocessor,
the same technology that drove the PC revolution.
As PCs became more powerful, games went hand in
hand. Before long, a multibillion dollar industry that dwarfs the
movie business had become the dominant form of consumer
entertainment. From *Space Invaders* and *Pac-Man* to movies inspired
by video games, video games have been both a cultural force and a
shaper of the IT industry.
