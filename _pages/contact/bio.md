Armando Fox is a Professor of Computer Science, Faculty Advisor for
Digital Learning Strategy, Campus Equity Advisor, and Computer Science
Diversity Officer at UC Berkeley.
With his colleague David Patterson,
he co-designed and co-taught Berkeley's first Massive Open Online
Course on "Engineering Software as a Service", offered through edX,
and co-authored the award-winning accompanying textbook of the same
name; this work was recognized in 2015 by the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator
Award.
His current research in CS education
focuses on creating novel technologies to help students
learn advanced programming concepts at scale.
He has given invited keynotes on these topics in Spanish and
English in the US, Asia, Spain, and Latin America.
_He has been invited to speak about software engineering
education at SIGCSE, ICSE, CSEET, and other leading venues on computer
science education, and has given invited keynotes at the Richard Tapia
Celebration of Diversity in Computing, the ACM India Annual Event, the
Japan Top Worldwide Universities Project, and (in Spanish) at SISTEDES
2012, SISTEDES 2015, and the Spanish-language tracks of EMOOCS 2017
and MOOCMaker 2017. He has also given advisory presentations on these
topics to the California State Legislature, the Chinese Ministry of
Education, and the University of Hong Kong._
In an earlier faculty position at  Stanford, 
he received teaching and mentoring awards from the Associated Students of
Stanford University, the Society of Women Engineers, and Tau Beta Pi
Engineering Honor Society. His degrees are in electrical
engineering (BS MIT, MS University of Illinois), computer
science (PhD UC Berkeley), and piano performance and musicology
(Mannes College of Music Certificate Program, 1986). He is
a classically-trained musician and performer, an avid musical theater
fan and freelance Music Director, and multilingual/bicultural
(Cuban-American) New Yorker who lives in San Francisco. 

More general bio
----------------

Armando Fox is a Professor of Computer Science, Faculty Advisor for
Digital Learning Strategy, and Associate Dean for Online Learning in
the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society.
His current research focuses on online and
technology-enhanced education, especially in computer science;
previous research includes high productivity parallel computing, cloud
computing, and Internet services. His current teaching activities
focus on undergraduate Software Engineering, for which he and
Prof. David Patterson created  the successful
textbook and accompanying online course *[Engineering Software as a
Service](http://saasbook.info/) *(saasbook.info).
and which serves as
the basis of Berkeley's first free MOOC (Massive Open Online
Course). Before returning to Berkeley, he was on the faculty
at Stanford, where he was recognized for both his
research (NSF CAREER award, Robert Noyce Family Faculty
Fellowship, IBM Young Faculty Fellowship) and his teaching (the
Associated Students of Stanford University Teaching Award, the Society
of Women Engineers Professor of the Year Award, and the Tau Beta Pi
Engineering Honor Society Teaching and Mentoring Award). His
collaborations with renowned computer architect and instructor
Prof. David Patterson have included Recovery-Oriented Computing,
Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems, the Berkeley Parallel Computing
Laboratory, the ASPIRE project for high-performance and
energy-efficient parallel computing, and most recently, co-authorship
of the new textbook Engineering Software as a Service that reflects
the state of the art in modern software engineering. He has been
recognized as the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator of 2015,
an ACM Distinguished Scientist, a Gilbreth Lecturer for the National
Academy of Engineering, a keynote speaker for the 2013 Tapia
Celebration of Diversity in Computing, and a Scientific American "Top
50" researcher. In previous lives he helped design the Intel Pentium
Pro microprocessor and founded a startup (subsequently acquired) to
commercialize his UC Berkeley dissertation research on mobile
computing. He received his other degrees in electrical engineering and
computer science from MIT and the University of Illinois. He is also a
classically-trained musician and performer, an avid musical theater
fan and freelance Music Director, and multilingual/bicultural
(Cuban-American) New Yorker living in San Francisco.
