Armando Fox (he/Ã©l/il/lui; PhD Berkeley 2000, MS University of
Illinois 1992, BS MIT 1990; armandofox.com) is a Professor of Computer
Science, Faculty Advisor for Digital Learning Strategy, and
EECS/CoE/Campus Equity Advisor at UC Berkeley.  His teaching and
research in CS Education and Software Engineering have resulted in
numerous awards, including the 2015 ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding
Educator Award, Scientific American "Top 50" researcher, and others.
Outside of Berkeley, he has served as Music Director for over 30
musicals in the Bay Area and elsewhere, several of which have won or been nominated
for awards, and has served on the Boards or Advisory Boards
of several local theaters.  He is classically trained (piano and other
instruments) since age 5.  Fox is the author of the best book on music
direction written by a computer scientist (pianoconductor.com) and
co-author of the best book on software engineering written by a music
director (www.saasbook.info).  He grew up in New York City and is
bicultural (Cuban-American) and multilingual.  And he doesn't take
himself terribly seriously.
