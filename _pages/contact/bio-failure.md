Armando Fox was denied tenure from Stanford's highly-ranked Computer
Science department in 2006. Prior to holding that position, he was
rejected from several top-10 Ph.D. programs, after having been
previously rejected from top Masters programs and from jobs and
internships at Apple and other leading tech companies. In 2006 he
returned to Berkeley, where he had previously obtained his
Ph.D. without particular distinction. Since then he has had nearly 100
scientific papers rejected from leading conferences and journals, has
been turned down for several major research grants, and has been
passed over for almost every major research award, including Best
Paper. He has founded or co-founded three startups, two of which
folded, and advised several others, most of which have also
folded. His other major passion over the last 35 years has been
classical music performance and musical theater, in which he has
obtained remarkably few distinctions despite serving as Music Director
for dozens of musicals. 

## Short version for brief talk bios:

Professor Armando Fox was denied tenure from Stanford's highly-ranked
Computer Science department in 2006. He has been rejected multiple
times from top graduate programs, passed over for positions at leading
tech companies, failed to win several awards in his field, and had
many papers rejected by leading conferences and journals. He has also
co-founded or advised several startups, most of which have failed.
