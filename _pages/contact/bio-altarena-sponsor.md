Armando Fox (he/Ã©l/il/lui) has over the years been an Altarena Board member,
volunteer, technical advisor, supporter, and most fun of all, Music
Director for many of its shows, including this season's upcoming "La
Cage aux Folles."  Altarena has long been his "third place," and he's
happy to have one more way to support this valuable
community institution and its artistic family, of which he's grateful
to be a part.  In real life he is a Computer Science professor at
UC Berkeley and has written (separate) books about software
engineering and music direction.  Armando grew up in New York going to
the theater and is Latino, multilingual, and bicultural.
