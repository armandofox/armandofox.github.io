# Piano/Conductor: So They Talked You Into Being Music Director
{: .section}

![](/assets/img/books/piano-conductor.jpeg){: .align-left .thumb}

Although I've had a good deal of formal training in piano performance, musicianship, theory, etc., like most Music Directors working in a nonprofessional setting I never received any formal training on how to do that.

It turns out there's a lot of non-obvious tasks in that job, and I wrote this book to pull them all together.

The book focuses on the **dual role **of the modern MD or Associate Conductor: sometimes you're leading the orchestra, sometimes you're a rhythm instrument. And you have to work with the actors (some of whom may also lack formal musical/vocal training) to help them learn often challenging songs, while managing the rehearsal schedule, figuring out which orchestra instruments you can do without, and so on. Substantially all of the techniques are illustrated with examples from the musical theater literature.

Download the free PDF [here](/assets/pdf/pianoconductor.pdf), or get hardcopy at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Piano-Conductor-Talked-Being-Director/dp/0984881298).

**Actors/Performers:**  You may find useful this [subset of the
book](/assets/pdf/pianoconductor-actor-chapters.pdf), which contains info
specifically useful when the MD works with actors on harmony singing,
tricky rhythms or melody lines, and so on.

# I'm Still Here: Memoirs 1957--1986
{: .section}

Yes, my dad's family really did own the Tropicana night club in Havana, and my parents really did go there on dates. Their story of leaving Cuba as political refugees, as told through my late mom's memoirs, has to be read to be believed. It reads like a good spy story in parts, or maybe even a good musical someday.

Here is the [free PDF](/assets/pdf/ImStillHere6x9.pdf)  but you can get hardcopy or a Kindle version on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Still-Here-1957-1986-Martorell-2016-05-01/dp/B01K32C4DU).
